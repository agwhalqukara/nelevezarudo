She revealed her recipe to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>The Cut</span></a><span>, "It contains coconut oil, flaxseed oil, banana, protein, some kind of antioxidant fruit like blueberries or strawberries, or some nut butter." When it comes to nut butters, "ounce for ounce, almonds are one of the most nutritious nuts," Stephanie Middleberg, MS, RD, CDN of </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Middleberg Nutrition</span></a><span>, told our sister site </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Eat This, Not That!</span></a><span>, which adds: "They're a great source of riboflavin, </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>magnesium</span></a><span>, and manganese (which, she explains, is great for the prevention of osteoporosis as well as a healthy metabolism), and also provide an impressive amount of vitamin E per serving.

She tells </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>InStyle</span></a><span>, "One meal in the day will be lighter than others, probably during lunch I will [eat something] heavier so that my body has time to burn it off.

One of these changes was not drinking coffee. "If you replace your coffee with a decaf tea or hot chocolate, it's a good way to reset your energy levels."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/GettyImages-1347462205.jpg><p><span>Swanepoel tells The Cut that she believes in a balanced diet, and still enjoys her favorite indulgences.
