So basically, Beverly Gail Allitt was born on 4 October 1968 and grew up in the village of&nbsp;Corby Glen&nbsp;near the town of&nbsp;Grantham. She had two sisters and a brother. Her father, Richard, worked in an&nbsp;off-licence&nbsp;and her mother as a school cleaner.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=s20c428d7e4f8fbb607cb621fbb09d2c9 data-wpel-link=internal><span class=ctaText>See also</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Beverley Allitt Family, Know Beverley Allitt Parents, and Husband</span></a><p>Allitt attended&nbsp;Charles Read Secondary Modern School, having failed the test to enter&nbsp;Kesteven and Grantham Girls’ School.&nbsp;Her nursing career started when she left school at the age of 16. The incident occurd in 1991, Beverley first killed four infants, then she attempt to murder three others and later caused grievous bodily harm to the six other.</p><p>After this brutal incident, in 1993 Alitt was arrested and recieved thirteen years in prison senteced at Nottingham Crown Court.&nbsp;At that time the judge was “Justice David Latham” and while sentencing to Alitt he told that she was “a serious danger” to others and was unlikely ever to be considered safe enough to be released.</p><h2 id=is-beverley-allitt-still-in-prison class="rb-heading-index-1 wp-block-heading">Is Beverley Allitt Still in Prison?</h2><p>Beverley Allitt is one of the serious danger as per the David Latham, what she did was very horriyfing, and as per laws she senteced to thirteen years in prison. The judge of that was also said that she was the danger to other. Well, many people have a confusion that is Beverley still in prison or is she released so if you also one of those people then let me tell you that although her minimum tariff expired in November 2021 and&nbsp;<strong>she is now eligible for release on parole</strong> but as of now <strong>she is still held at Rampton Hospital in Nottinghamshire</strong>, which is a high-security psychiatric facility.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=s20c428d7e4f8fbb607cb621fbb09d2c9 data-wpel-link=internal><span class=ctaText>See also</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Beverley Allitt Family, Know Beverley Allitt Parents, and Husband</span></a><h2 id=is-beverley-allitt-released class="rb-heading-index-2 wp-block-heading">Is Beverley Allitt Released?</h2><p>On 28 May 1993, she was found guilty on each chargeell. Well, there is also a documenatry based on this incident. In the documentary, Allitt reportedly told close friends before her trial that she would never go to prison. After one week in prison, she refused to eat or drink and was moved to Rampton Secure Hospital.</p><p>Well, Allitt’s motives have never been fully explained and according to one theory, she showed symptoms of a&nbsp;factitious disorder&nbsp;also known as&nbsp;<strong>Munchausen syndrome by proxylet</strong>. Now if you still confused then let me tell you that <strong>Allitt is not released yet</strong> and is not likely to be release as per the judge who sentenced her thirteen years in prison.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHb7rAspigZpOkunDDx56pnmWZqHqjsdWeqaWdqWKurbjIratmpp%2BsfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./naomi-watts-news-us-weekly.html><span>←</span><span>Naomi Watts News - Us Weekly</span></a>
