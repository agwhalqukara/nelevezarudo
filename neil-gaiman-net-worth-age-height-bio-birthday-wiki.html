When I become an author, I want to be able to do things in parentheses.’ I liked the power of putting things in brackets.” Narnia also introduced him to literary awards, specifically the 1956 Carnegie Medal won by the concluding volume. When Gaiman won the 2010 Medal himself, the press reported him recalling, “it had to be the most important literary award there ever was” and observing, “if you can make yourself aged seven happy, you’re really doing well – it’s like writing a letter to yourself aged seven.”</p><h2>Neil Gaiman Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Neil Gaiman is one of the <strong>richest Novelist</strong> from United Kingdom.
