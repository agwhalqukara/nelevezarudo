While still an infant, the Ntokozo Mdluli family moved to Piet Retief in the Mpumalanga province of South Africa. In the picture above, he is with his parents, three brothers, and two nephews.</p><h3>Education</h3><p class=align-left>After his matric, he joined the Vaal University of Technology for a National Diploma in Public Relations Management. It was at Vaal that he met Ezee "Ma-E" Hanabe and Bantu "Ntukza" Hanabe, who would be his future bandmates. After graduating, he was unemployed for 2 years before his mother forwarded his CV to the South African Police Service, but he did not go for the interview. Instead, he preferred to work in public relations while pursuing his dreams of becoming a musician. His parents, who were very supportive of his dreams, funded his demos.</p><h3>Career</h3><p class=align-left>In 2005, Ntokozo formed the band Teargas together with Ma-E and Ntukza whom he had met at university. The decision to link up was made as the trio knew each other’s style of music and were in sync with one another. Teargas released its debut fifteen-track album in 2006 titled K’shubile K’bovu, and it was an instant hit. Two years later, Teargas blessed us again with another album called Wafa Wafa that has sixteen songs, and the next year, a thirteen-track album titled Dark or Blue. In 2012, the trio released their fourth studio album, Number Number.</p><p class=align-left>In 2013, K.O, together with Ma-E and marketing executive Thabiso Khati, formed the company Cashtime Life. Incidentally, K.O was the first artist to be signed by the label. Soon after, K.O Mission Statement was released, which is the first single of his first album. Unsurprisingly, the single was a massive hit in South Africa. In November 2014, the first K.O solo album containing 11 songs, Shkanda Republic, was released.</p><p class=align-left>In 2016, Ntokozo released a much-anticipated single titled Don Dada together with Okmalumkoolkat. The K.O new album was released in 2017 titled SKR2. You may have noticed that Teargas has not featured much since the launch of Cashtime. That is because, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">according to the rapper</a>, the group has taken a break from one another.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/a778d0fd81f7dd38.png><h4><strong>K.O albums</strong></h4><p class=align-left>The following are KO albums, both solo and as part of Teargas:</p><ul><li>2006- K’shubile K’bovu as Teargas</li><li>2008- Wafa Wafa as Teargas</li><li>2009- Dark or Blue as Teargas</li><li>2012- Num8er Num8er as Teargas</li><li>2014- Skhanda Republic</li><li>2017- K.O Skhanda Republic 2</li><li>2019- KO new album PTYULTD</li></ul><h4><strong>K.O songs</strong></h4><p class=align-left>His songs include:</p><ul><li>Pretty Young Thing</li><li>Zato sto sam Rom</li><li>I Had Struggles Too</li><li>Miracle</li><li>PTY UnLTD</li><li>Above the Water</li><li>K.O Skhanda Love</li><li>SA Rising</li><li>Pretty Young Thing</li><li>Wuts Hapnin'</li><li>Waya Waya</li><li>SR2</li><li>Cara Cara</li><li>Mission Statement</li><li>Supa Dupa</li><li>Call Me</li><li>K.O ft Sjava – Flight School</li><li>Crazyer</li><li>Come Into</li><li>Askies I'm Sorry</li><li>Simple Mind</li><li>The Big Heartbreak</li><li>Delakufa</li><li>Flying</li><li>K.O One Time</li><li>The Curve</li><li>Papa Action</li><li>Son of a Gun</li><li>MS2</li><li>Ding Dong</li><li>Fire Emoji</li><li>Money & Love</li><li>Weirdos</li><li>Benithin</li><li>Nombolo</li></ul><h3>Ntokozo Mdluli wife</h3><p class=align-left>The rapper is not married. Neither is there a Ntokozo Mdluli girlfriend at the moment according to most sources. However, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">back in 2014,</a> he used to date Wits University graduate and model called Sarah Nomalanga Heaton, but they<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> split.</a></p><h3>Cars</h3><p class=align-left>You will hardly ever see flashy pictures of the rapper on the K.O Instagram page, but he works just as hard as any successful artist does. This modesty can be seen as one of his cars is actually a pimped out <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">soccer mom car.</a> However, he dreams of owning a BMW M4, which he<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> cannot afford</a> at the moment.</p><h3>Ntokozo Mdluli house</h3><p class=align-left>Back in 2016, the rapper took to social media to show fans his home and how he lives with his family. He even shows fans the place he helps his father do the gardening in the backyard. It is nothing flashy but respectable nonetheless.</p><h2>Latest news</h2><p class=align-left>The world may be under lockdown but music is not and K.O is doing really well. Today, he posted that his brand new single #LuckyStar is now available on all platforms! Previously, he took to Twitter and Instagram to celebrate and thank SA because his name has appeared five times on South Africa’S top 50 radio charts.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Top 10 richest rappers in South Africa</p><p class=align-left>Be it struggles or successes, K.O has seen it all and powered through.
