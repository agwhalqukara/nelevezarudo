<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Marvel Star Laura Harrier Shares Swimsuit Poolside At Home</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><span>Marvel star Laura Harrier enjoyed a much-needed staycation over the summer, soaking up the sun by her pool. The </span><i><span>Spider-Man: Homecoming </span></i><span>star, 33, shared a selfie of herself posing on a sun lounger in a brown bikini and dark sunglasses, glowing in the sunshine. No plane tickets needed! "Poolside at home in @aerie swim ü§é," she captioned the post. "Obsessed with this combo! üòç," the Aerie official account commented. Here's how Harrier lives a healthy, balanced life (while eating all the pasta).</span></p><p><span>Harrier mixes up her workouts and also meditates. "I actually woke up this morning and went to a barre class at Physique57," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "I kind of hate barre‚Äîit's so hard. I like SoulCycle, and have an amazing trainer, Kirk Myers, at Dogpound here in New York. We do circuit training, and I box there. I always make coffee, and then I take these really gross Lypo-Spheric Vitamin C packets. They're gooey and taste like trash, but they're supposed to be good for you. I take a shot of green juice as a chaser, and then I'll have avocado toast or peanut butter with a banana. I try to meditate a bit, too. I was using Headspace and then I was like, I can do this on my own. But I just sit there."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/shutterstock_2277353655.jpg><p><span>Harrier wants to destigmatize therapy in the Black community. "There's been such a long history of ignoring mental health problems, of saying, 'Oh, just suck it up,' or, 'I'm a strong Black woman. That doesn't happen to me,'" </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "I try to meditate. I can't say that I'm the best with my track record of doing it every day, but I try to at least do some deep breathing. I noticed I literally forget to breathe, which sounds wild, but sometimes I'm like, 'Wait, I haven't taken a real breath all day,' and just taking 30 seconds to sit and do deep belly breathing is a game changer."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/shutterstock_182042609.jpg><p><span>Harrier gained an appreciation for sardines during a trip to Italy. "I spent a week in Sicily with two of my best friends, eating pasta and driving around," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "We actually became friends with these cute Italian guys who we met on the beach. They came over and cooked for us one night; it was great! I never like sardines, but one of the guys pan-fried them and poured this crazy lemon-basil sauce all over them. It was amazing! He also made pasta with swordfish. The meal was so insane. I was like, is this my life right now? We also went to a natural wine vineyard in Sicily. It was magic."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/shutterstock_2215207111.jpg><p><span>Harrier believes self-care is important‚Äîand it doesn't have to be worthy. "I think it's so common to talk only about self-care as mediation, yoga, and working out, which are all important," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "But sometimes self-care is having a glass of wine with your best friend and laughing and watching reality TV. Sometimes that's the self-care that you need."</span></p><p><span>Harrier lets herself fully enjoy vacations and then makes up for it when she gets home. "When I'm traveling, I try to fully embrace wherever I am‚Äîfor me, that means embracing the food," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "If this is a trip that's super memorable and special to me, it's worth it to indulge. I'm going to have the gelato; I'm going to eat all the things. And then when I get home, I will go to the gym everyday. When you're in these special spaces in the world, the full experience means having all of the things. I let myself do that and try not to feel guilty."</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxkppmiq7KtedKtmKtlnJbCs62MoZirqpmav261zWaqsKGdqMKqwIyiqmaon6S5tLXDnmSarF2dvK6xjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fake-snake-prank-reveals-the-unique-language-of-chimpanzees.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Fake Snake Prank Reveals The Unique Language Of Chimpanzees</span></a>
