During an interview with <a href=#>Access Hollywood Live</a> on Wednesday, July 16, the Major Crimes actor, 43, confessed to having a bit of a crush on his onscreen sister back in the day.</p><p>“Early on, it was Lisa, just because we were so close in age,” he said of Bonet, now 46 and married to Game of Thrones actor <strong>Jason Momoa</strong>. (She was also wed to singer <strong>Lenny Kravitz</strong>, with whom she shares daughter <strong>Zoe Kravitz</strong>.) “But, you know, I never had a shot,” Warner continued. “You just know. At 13, 14, you know when you have a shot or not, even at that age.”</p><p>The actor—who has never been married but had relationships with actresses <strong>Regina Hall</strong>, <strong>Karen Malina White</strong>, and the late <strong>Michelle Thomas</strong> (who played his girlfriend Justine on The Cosby Show)—went on to say that he still has fond (but platonic) feelings for the A Different World actress.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“She’s cool. Lisa and I, we’ve always been very cool,” he told Access Hollywood Live. “But I’m cool with everyone on the show, because we all, you know, bonded over such a unique experience that that bond, no matter how much time goes by that we don’t speak, that bond is still there, very strong.”</p><p>As the world knows, The Cosby Show revolved around the upper middle-class Huxtable family, made up of parents Cliff (<strong>Bill Cosby</strong>) and Clair (<strong>Phylicia Rashad</strong>), and kids Theo (Warner), Denise (Bonet), Vanessa (<strong>Tempestt Bledsoe</strong>), Rudy (<strong>Keshia Knight Pulliam</strong>), and Sondra (<strong>Sabrina Le Beauf</strong>).</p><p>“I think [that bond is] one of the reasons the show worked so well, and one of the reasons the Huxtables as a family just gelled,” Warner said of the NBC hit series, which ran for eight seasons from 1984 to 1992. “We all really had a genuine, mutual respect and appreciation for each other, to the point that people would come on the set and talk about how rare our vibe was on the show. There was just no drama,” he added. “Everybody really was there about the work. We all had a good time, but we also knew when to be serious, as well.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOppilm5%2Bhum62wKaYpWWnlr%2BvsdFmn5qcXZZ6pL7UrJ9mp55itaq%2FjJymrJqpYsCpu9ZmqqKrpJq%2FbrjIrJhmmp%2BjsrV5kWlobWlnbA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jill-derick-ben-jessa-duggar-spinoff-in-the-works-amid-scandal.html><span>←</span><span>Jill, Derick, Ben, Jessa Duggar Spinoff In the Works Amid Scandal</span></a>
