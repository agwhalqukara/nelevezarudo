The latter’s real name is Marcus Gray. He sued the singer for <a href=#>copyright infringement because parts of ‘Dark Horse’ song</a> resembled ‘Joyful Noise.’</p><p>Gray owns the rights to ‘Joyful Noise’ which is his Christian rap song that came out in 2008. The federal jury decided 22.5% of all profits earned by Perry and her team should be paid to Gray because of the ‘Joyful Noise’ resemblance.</p><p>According to CNN, the overall amount is $2.8 million. It will be broken out among, Perry, Capitol Records, as wells producers Max Martin and Dr. Luke.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Katy Perry lost the lawsuit this week that claimed she copied Flame’s "Joyful Noise" on her "Dark Horse" track. Here’s the Mashup. What do u think? <a href=# rel=nofollow>https://t.co/0RF5absPaI</a></p><p>— C🌷m i l l e ❁ (@cafecamille) <a href=# rel=nofollow>August 3, 2019</a></p><p>Perry is on the hook for $550,000. Capital Records has to pay $1.3 million. Martin owes $253,000, while Dr. Luke has to pay $61,000 and his company Kasz Money Inc must pay $189,000.</p><p>Although the jury did not decide in her favor, Perry’s attorney Christine Lepera said the singer is expected to appeal. She also stated all of the writers behind ‘Dark Horse’ view the verdict as a travesty.</p><p>Katy Perry’s ‘Dark Horse’ case is just one of several high-profile cases that have cost singer’s money when it comes to copyrights. Marvin Gaye’s estate sued Robin Thicke, Pharrell Williams and rapper T.I. over the 2013 single, ‘Blurred Lines.’</p><p>Gaye’s family felt Thicke’s song infringed on Gaye’s 1977 hit ‘Got to Give it Up.’ A jury sided with the family. Although T.I was released from the lawsuit, both Williams and Thicke were ordered to pay the estate $7 million. After the appeals process, the estate was awarded $5 million.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Katy Perry And Her 'Dark Horse' Collaborators Owe $2.78 Million In Copyright Suit<a href=# rel=nofollow>https://t.co/jWCrK23ZAW</a><a href=# rel=nofollow>#DLBNews</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/TvXXcAWmWD</a></p><p>— DLB News (@DLBNewsonline) <a href=# rel=nofollow>August 3, 2019</a></p><p>Katy Perry has not yet responded to the outcome of the lawsuit. In the wake of several lawsuits involving mainstreaming singers, there is a question of how much music can actually be copyrighted. There are only so many notes in music after all, and at times it can all sound similar.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>The case is far from over, and the appeal process could take a while. However, there is little chance Perry will walk away without having to pay a penny. At best in the appeals process could reduce the amount of cash the singer has to pay Flame.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeblsG6ec%2BeqauxXaG8tLHSZpuaqptitbC%2B0p5knKegrr%2Bqs8etZKWZp6jCqsCMrKCnn5Wneqe70ZycnWWkpHqxrdhmmaKfXZfCpLfSZmppb2dnhHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./frank-iero-and-the-patience-release-new-song-from-upcoming-album-parachutes.html><span>←</span><span>Frank Iero and The Patience Release New Song From Upcoming Album, 'Parachutes'</span></a>
