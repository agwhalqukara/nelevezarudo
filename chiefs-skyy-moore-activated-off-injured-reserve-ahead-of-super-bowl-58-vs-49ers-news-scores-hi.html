He had been sidelined since suffering a knee injury in Week 15 against the New England Patriots.</p><p>Moore was designated to return from his knee injury earlier in the postseason, but he re-injured his knee during practice and remained unavailable.</p><p>The Chiefs selected Moore in the second round of the 2022 draft out of Western Michigan, though he hasn't made much of an impact through his first two NFL seasons.</p><p>The 23-year-old caught 22 passes for 250 yards in 16 games as a rookie, and Chiefs head coach Andy Reid told reporters ahead of the 2023 campaign that the team was expecting him to step up in his sophomore season.</p><p>"We are expecting Skyy Moore to step up. We'll just see how everything else works," Reid told NFL Network's Steve Wyche in March (h/t NFL.com's <a href=# rel=noopener>Christian Gonzales</a>). "We got the same guys coming back that we had, and we like that group with the exception of JuJu [Smith-Schuster]. Mecole [Hardman] was banged up a little bit so he didn't have a chance to play as much as he wanted. We'll work out the thing without JuJu."</p><p>Moore didn't live up to expectations this year, catching just 21 passes for 244 yards and one touchdown in 14 games before hitting the shelf for the final three games of the regular season.</p><p>While Moore is slated to return, it's unclear if he'll have much of a role in the Super Bowl. Tight end Travis Kelce is Patrick Mahomes' top target and rookie wide receiver Rashee Rice has also emerged as a reliable target for the veteran quarterback.</p><p>Other options include Hardman, Marquez Valdes-Scantling and Justin Watson.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYG2BeIOMnJ%2BinZaoerS32LJkpqefp7JurcKtoK%2BZpJqxbrvFn2Sippqqv6awjKucrJ2iq7JurceemJ1ln5t6tMHPnqlmmp%2BsuW6Bl2atrGVkbrKzvw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./candy-rain-lyrics.html><span>←</span><span>Candy Rain Lyrics</span></a>
