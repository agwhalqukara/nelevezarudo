Rap consists of rhymes and street language, mostly sung over an instrumental background track. Many rappers prefer baggy t-shirts, baggy jeans, a hat and/or bandana, lots of jewelry, big sunglasses, jackets, and of course shoes as their standard clothes. A few have created their own style, such as 6ix9ine, whose unconventional look is one of his selling points.</p><h2><strong>6ix9ine Bio</strong></h2><p>Records indicate that 6ix9ine, also known as Tekashi69, was born on May 8, 1996, as Daniel Hernandez in Bushwick, Brooklyn, New York. His father was originally from Puerto Rico and his mother was from Atlixco, Mexico. He was raised with his brother (and only sibling) by both parents until the murder of his father in 2009. This changed things for the family, and Daniel had to step in by doing several jobs and even selling cannabis to help them survive. He was expelled from school in grade 8 and never went back.</p><p>In 2014 he started his rap career by producing and releasing several songs. His rap was aggressive and he used anime as visual material for his videos. These attracted some attention in his own way, but not enough to make it a hit. 6ix9ine is also known as the rapper with multicolored hair and plated grids. The Slovakian music label FCK THEM was behind the release of most of his opening songs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/6ix9ine-Wiki.jpg><p>His rap name is 6ix9ine, a clear deviation from his birth name Daniel. He says that 69 actually shows that there are different perspectives on a thing, depending on how you look at it. 6ix9ine used social media platforms to further his rap career and is quite active on a number of them. On Facebook, he is known as Tekashi 6ix9ine, and he has over a million sympathizers and even more followers. His biography on Twitter says he is the “King of New York” and has over 349,000 followers. The rapper has a whopping 14.6 million followers on Instagram and more than 4.8 million subscribers on his YouTube channel. As good as these seem, the truth is that he hasn’t always been that popular.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Sindarius Thornwell Bio, Height, Weight, Body Measurements, Family</a></strong></p><p>Tekashi69 achieved fame in 2017 when a July picture he posted on Instagram became an Internet memoir. In this picture he was on his characteristic rainbow hair, the grill, and 69 were tattooed on several parts of his body. He became even more famous when his first commercial single, entitled Gummo, was broadcast on the radio in November 2017. The song made it to number 12 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and was awarded platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in March 2018. It currently has over 80 million hits on YouTube. Kooda and Keke were its second and third commercial singles, released December 23, 2017, and January 14, 2018, respectively.</p><p>6ix9ine released his first mixtape, entitled Day69, on February 23, 2018. Two songs from the tape, Billy and Rondo, became the Billboard Hot 100. In April, he also released Gotti, which appeared six consecutive times on Hot 100. In July he sang Nicki Minaj and Murda Beatz in his song Fefe, which was released on Hot 100 in fourth place and then in third place. His next song is expected later in October, as indicated on a video he posted on Instagram but deleted. From June 15 to July 6 he had a World Domination European Tour in 13 cities.</p><p>Hernandez faced a number of legal problems, including a 2015 child sexual harassment offense count, the case was tried in court and the sentence is expected on October 26, 2018, and he faces a likely three-year prison sentence and registration as a sex offender. He also had a number of feuds with rappers such as Chief Keef, who was allegedly shot on June 2 in New York City. 6ix9ine is under investigation for the shooting, although he was in Los Angeles at the time of the shooting. He was kidnapped, beaten, and stolen on July 22, shortly after filming Fefe.</p><p>Interestingly, in April, he hinted on Instagram that he might stop rapping this year (2018) as he had already achieved his goals. Let’s take a look at it.</p><h2><strong>6ix9ine Girlfriend, Who Is His Daughter?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/6ix9ine-and-his-daughter.jpg decoding=async alt="6ix9ine Wiki, Net Worth, Girlfriend, Is He Gay, Who Is The Daughter?" width=700 height=700 title="6ix9ine Wiki, Net Worth, Girlfriend, Is He Gay, Who Is The Daughter?" data-sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Daniel has a mom named Sara. She was his girlfriend for many years, even before he became famous. Together they have a daughter named Saraiyah.</p><p>He allegedly has another girlfriend named Leezah, who works as a stripper in a New York gentleman club called Starlet. She is from the Dominican Republic and it is said that he took her on a trip to her home country and even met her family.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Christopher Lloyd Bio, Spouse, Net Worth, Dead Or Alive, Here Are Facts</a></strong></p><h2><strong>6ix9ine Net Worth</strong></h2><p>The net value of the rapper has been reported differently by various sources ranging from $500,000 to $4 million to $7.5 million. While we are not sure of any figure, we know that he is likely to be worth a great deal due to his apparent success.</p><h2><strong>Is He Gay?</strong></h2><p>6ix9ine was accused of being gay by his fellow rapper <a href=#>Trippie Redd</a> after a feud they had. He went even further by circulating sex videos of Apache Blu, a gay p*rn star who he claimed was really Hernandez. It was later proven that the rapper and the p*rn star are two different people.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51kg6rEmKKlnmWnnriqec2eq2avn6fBqXnGoqmlnqKesq%2BwjKKqZqCVYrSixYywn6hlmah6tbTEZpuarZedwaa%2Bjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./taj-cross-is-a-fast-rising-actor-and-social-media-influencer.html><span>←</span><span>Taj Cross is a Fast Rising Actor and Social Media Influencer</span></a>
