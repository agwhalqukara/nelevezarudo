The actress made her first appearance as the iconic character in the Arrowverse’s “Elseworlds” crossover in May 2018 and two months later, the <a href=#>CW announced a spinoff series</a> was in development. Batwoman premiered in October 2019 and was met with a positive fan response, becoming <a href=#>the network’s third most-watched show</a>. Now, two years after first donning the cape, Ruby Rose revealed she is leaving the show.</p><p>“I have made the very difficult decision to not return to Batwoman next season,” Rose said in a statement on May 19. “This was not a decision I made lightly as I have the utmost respect for the cast, crew, and everyone involved with the show in both Vancouver and in Los Angeles. I am beyond appreciative to Greg Berlanti, Sarah Schechter, and Caroline Dries for not only giving me this incredible opportunity but for welcoming me into the DC universe they have so beautifully created. Thank you, Peter Roth and Mark Pedowitz, and the teams at Warner Bros. and The CW who put so much into the show and always believed in me. Thank you to everyone who made season one a success – I am truly grateful.”</p><p>Rose’s exit comes as a huge surprise to fans since the show was just <a href=#>renewed for a second season</a> in January and its season finale aired on Sunday, May 17. Season one was supposed to have 22 episodes, but due to the coronavirus pandemic, it ended at episode 20. Despite Rose’s departure, season two is still expected to premiere in 2021, but with a new leading lady.</p><p>In a joint statement, Warner Bros. TV, the CW, and Berlanti Productions thanked Rose for her contributions and reassured fans the show will continue. “The studio and network are firmly committed to Batwoman’s second season and long-term future, and we — along with the show’s talented creative team — look forward to sharing its new direction, including the casting of a new lead actress and member of the LGBTQ community, in the coming months,” they said.</p><p>Batwoman is the first gay lead character of a live-action superhero series. Although Rose is leaving the show, her impact won’t be forgotten by fans.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>What do you think of Ruby Rose’s decision?
