When he shared his wardrobe related concerns with us</h3><p lang=en dir=ltr>I feel like I should own more velvet tracksuits…</p><p>— Harry Styles. (@Harry_Styles) <a href=#>October 11, 2011</a></p><p>We’d like to see this happen.</p><h3>21. When he talked about his&nbsp;experiences on the road</h3><p lang=en dir=ltr>Am I the only person who doesn't floss while driving?!</p><p>— Harry Styles. (@Harry_Styles) <a href=#>June 20, 2013</a></p><p>No idea who you’ve been carpooling with besides James Corden but no Harry, you’re probably not the only one who doesn’t floss while driving.</p><h3>20. Spreading this truth</h3><p lang=en dir=ltr>Shania Twain is so good.</p><p>— Harry Styles. (@Harry_Styles) <a href=#>October 8, 2013</a></p><p>Can’t disagree with him on this one, can you?</p><h3>19. Harry Styles and the Numb Body Parts</h3><p lang=en dir=ltr>Woke up in a sterling mood today!! Hope everyone's good!! I slept on my arm and now it's floppy….</p><p>— Harry Styles. (@Harry_Styles) <a href=#>December 11, 2011</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Spiffing Morning!!! Somehow slept on my nose and now it looks wonky…</p><p>— Harry Styles. (@Harry_Styles) <a href=#>January 2, 2012</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I slept on my shoulder, now my left arm is numb and is just hanging. It seems to be about 4 inches longer than my right. Cool.</p><p>— Harry Styles. (@Harry_Styles) <a href=#>September 7, 2012</a></p><p>To be continued, probably.</p><h3>18. Asking the question that all of us wish we never asked</h3><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>@lostboyhoran</a> what does otp mean?</p><p>— Harry Styles. (@Harry_Styles) <a href=#>April 18, 2013</a></p><p>We’ve all been there.</p><h3>17. Expressing his love for a certain movie</h3><p lang=en dir=ltr>The last scene of Grease is still the best piece of cinematic genius I have ever seen.</p><p>— Harry Styles. (@Harry_Styles) <a href=#>April 25, 2013</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Always feel lucky when Grease songs come on the radio.</p><p>— Harry Styles. (@Harry_Styles) <a href=#>June 5, 2013</a></p><p>Hey Harry, we know another One Direction member who really loves Grease… maybe you could watch it together sometimes?</p><h3>16. When he was all of us</h3><p lang=en dir=ltr>Hiiii, I slept all day. Ate cereal at 5pm.</p><p>— Harry Styles. (@Harry_Styles) <a href=#>April 3, 2013</a></p><p>Who hasn’t done this at least once?</p><h3>15. This (not so thrilling) saga</h3><p lang=und dir=ltr>It's 2013.</p><p>— Harry Styles. (@Harry_Styles) <a href=#>January 1, 2013</a></p><p lang=und dir=ltr>It's 2014.</p><p>— Harry Styles. (@Harry_Styles) <a href=#>January 3, 2014</a></p><p lang=und dir=ltr>It's 2015.</p><p>— Harry Styles. (@Harry_Styles) <a href=#>January 1, 2015</a></p><p lang=qst dir=ltr>2016.</p><p>— Harry Styles. (@Harry_Styles) <a href=#>January 2, 2016</a></p><p>A man of few words, that Harry Styles.</p><h3>14. This rather interesting tweet</h3><p lang=en dir=ltr>Unidentified gel in deceivingly small tube does not taste the same as toothpaste. Fact.</p><p>— Harry Styles. (@Harry_Styles) <a href=#>January 23, 2014</a></p><p>We’d like to know what exactly went down in the Styles household for this tweet to happen, but we have some ideas…</p><h3>13. This joke</h3><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>@joshua_fox</a> literally working hard?</p><p>— Harry Styles. (@Harry_Styles) <a href=#>May 26, 2014</a></p><p>It’s even better when you open the picture in the tweet Harry replied to. As we have argued before in <a href=#>this article</a>, Harry Styles&nbsp;is One Direction’s funniest member.</p><h3>12. When he persistently ignored the fact that One Direction’s album leaked</h3><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>@happilysusie</a> but you haven't heard that yet. Have you. Have you. Nope.</p><p>— Harry Styles. (@Harry_Styles) <a href=#>November 13, 2014</a></p><p>Our favourite time of the year: One Direction Album Leak Season. Since there isn’t any real harm done as 1D’s wonderful fans buy the album anyway, it’s always fun to watch any of the boys pretending it didn’t happen.</p><h3>11. When he and Nick Grimshaw fought their issues out online</h3><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>@grimmers</a> you never call anymore. You've left me no choice.</p><p>— Harry Styles. (@Harry_Styles) <a href=#>October 22, 2015</a></p><p>Don’t worry, Gryles&nbsp;is still going strong. Nick was just replying to one of Harry’s tweets in which he teased some Hey Angel lyrics and Harry didn’t hesitate to hit back with another joke.</p><h3>10. Opening up about Louis’ toilet habits</h3><p lang=en dir=ltr>If <a href=#>@Louis_Tomlinson</a> feels tired…he sits down to have a wee…I've seen it.</p><p>— Harry Styles. (@Harry_Styles) <a href=#>September 1, 2011</a></p><p>Another one of those tweets that have us wondering what goes down in the Styles household.</p><h3>9. Opening up about Liam’s problems</h3><p lang=en dir=ltr>Liam just dribbled on a suitcase.</p><p>— Harry Styles. (@Harry_Styles) <a href=#>January 13, 2012</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Long flight…slightly worried that Liam is going to dribble on me while he's asleep.</p><p>— Harry Styles. (@Harry_Styles) <a href=#>April 9, 2012</a></p><p>We&nbsp;could make a cheesy joke about how Harry makes us drool as well, but we won’t.</p><h3>8. When he was living the dream</h3><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>@Louis_Tomlinson</a> just came and got in my bed with a cup of tea. Backstreet Boys are on 4Music… Typical Wednesday.</p><p>— Harry Styles. (@Harry_Styles) <a href=#>November 22, 2011</a></p><p>Our invite probably got lost in the mail.</p><h3>7.&nbsp;When he was full of great advice</h3><p lang=en dir=ltr>Hello… If you're hanging around with some friends today with 9 hours to kill..<br>You could all watch 'THIS IS US' 6 times! What a day…</p><p>— Harry Styles. (@Harry_Styles) <a href=#>August 29, 2013</a></p><p>Funny, Harry. It’s not like anyone would really do that. Certainly not us. No.</p><h3>6. When he was very happy and maybe a little bit drunk</h3><p lang=en dir=ltr>A moment, a love, a dream, a laugh, a kiss, a cry, our rights, our wrongs…A Moment AAAHHHHHH!!</p><p>— Harry Styles. (@Harry_Styles) <a href=#>April 23, 2012</a></p><p>Add to this tweet the rare footage we have of this night and yeah – we’re pretty sure Harry was having&nbsp;a lot&nbsp;of fun in Wellington in April 2012.</p><h3>5. More great advice</h3><p lang=en dir=ltr>Never make eye contact with anyone while eating a banana.</p><p>— Harry Styles. (@Harry_Styles) <a href=#>June 23, 2013</a></p><p>Curious advice coming from a guy who has been eating banana’s in front of thousands of people for years, but we’ll take it anyway.</p><h3>4. When he was his lovely supportive self</h3><p lang=en dir=ltr>Despite the company outside, I believe in equal rights for everyone. I think God loves all. Thanks for coming to the show though.</p><p>— Harry Styles. (@Harry_Styles) <a href=#>July 20, 2013</a></p><p>A true classic: one of the first times Harry openly voiced his support for the LGBTQ+ community. Thinking of how many times he has done the same thing since then never fails to warm our hearts.</p><h3>3. When he studied rainbows</h3><p lang=en dir=ltr>I study rainbows.</p><p>— Harry Styles. (@Harry_Styles) <a href=#>January 14, 2015</a></p><p>One of Harry’s most popular tweets – though there has been a bit of discussion about what&nbsp;it exactly means. We’re sure he’ll explain in due time.</p><h3>2. When he got us all crying our eyes out</h3><p lang=en dir=ltr>It's been five years. Thank you for all your support so far. Isn't it lovely. H</p><p>— Harry Styles. (@Harry_Styles) <a href=#>April 11, 2015</a></p><p>The perfect mixture of emotional and funny – thanking his fans for the support, but not letting the opportunity slide to&nbsp;reference his audition song. We love you, Harry.</p><h3>1. When he&nbsp;came up with this beautiful motto</h3><p lang=en dir=ltr>Be nice to nice.</p><p>— Harry Styles. (@Harry_Styles) <a href=#>August 13, 2014</a></p><p>Harry Styles, you truly are an inspiration to us all. Happy birthday.</p><p>What do you think of this list? Did we miss any iconic tweets?
