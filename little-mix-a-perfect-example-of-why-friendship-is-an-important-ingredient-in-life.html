Friendship, in the words of J.M. Nouwen:

So after searching high and low, there was one quote that said it all.</p><p>Friendship, in the words of J.M. Nouwen:</p><p><strong>“When we honestly ask ourselves which person in our lives mean the most to us, we often find that it is those who, instead of giving advice, solutions, or cures, have chosen rather to share our pain and touch our wounds with a warm and tender hand. The friend who can be silent with us in a moment of despair or confusion, who can stay with us in an hour of grief and bereavement, who can tolerate not knowing, not curing, not healing and face with us the reality of our powerlessness, that is a friend who cares.”</strong></p><p>Powerful indeed right?</p><p>As soon as we read this quote, we were immediately mentally directed to the beautiful and growing friendship of Little Mix, the girl group who have the biggest tour of their career so far.</p><p>When you think about vocal groups in general, you think “how in the world can X amount of people be around each other for so long”? Well, there’s a very simple answer to that question. It’s called the power of friendship. A cliche but simple answer.</p><p>No matter how many years go by, friendship continues to thrive even when people are separated from each other. But it’s the continuity of friendship when a group of friends are together, that really tests the power of happiness and selfless love.</p><p>When Jesy Nelson, Perrie Edwards, Jade Thirlwall and Leigh-Anne Pinnock were first put together on the reality TV show, the X-Factor, we’re pretty darn sure they had no idea what the future was going to entail. They didn’t know if the group was going to work, they didn’t know how well they were going to sound together, and they really didn’t know what to expect from their friendships.</p><p>But somehow, everything magically came together. In the words of Leigh-Anne Pinnock, “it was almost like a dream”. But we all sometimes dream of having that perfect friendship; that one person that would go the extra mile for us and of course receive the same respect and tenacity.</p><p>Looking at Little Mix, you not only see persistence, you see grace, positivity and a beloved attitude. The video below, really showcases that growth and how friendship isn’t just about mutual respect, but understanding each other on an emotional level.</p><p></p><p>Gary Barlow, Kelly Rowland, Tulisa and Louis Walsh all saw their obvious talent – but they also pointed out another key factor to their potential success. Friendship.</p><p>And look at where they are now. They’re currently the biggest girl group in the world.&nbsp;Don’t believe us? Well, that’s exactly what the TODAY show had to say about Little Mix.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/little-mix-a-perfect-example-of-why-friendship-is-an-important-ingredient-to-life-02.jpg alt="Little Mix: A Perfect Example Of Why Friendship Is An Important Ingredient To Life 2" width=736 height=466 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Sounds about right to us.</p><p><span>By the looks of it now, these girls are set to reach the 20 million&nbsp;mark (in terms of records sold) by the end of the Get Weird era. It’s fairly easy to make that assumption, since their staple hit ‘Black Magic’ is a multi-platinum hit. Another successful era to add to Little Mix’s flourishing career.</span></p><p>At the end of the day, like almost any other great vocal group, Little Mix were at once strangers; now they’re the closest of friends and are continuing this magnificent musical journey. Sure their will probably be a few bumps here and there, but what matters is that their friendship radiates to the crowd beautifully as well as their ongoing musical success.</p><p><span>Tag us on Twitter <a href=#>@CelebMix</a>, and let us know what you think of Little Mix’s friendship.
