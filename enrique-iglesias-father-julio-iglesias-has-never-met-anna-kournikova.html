The Latin singer made the surprising admission in <a href=#>Billboard's </a>April 2014 issue.</p><p>"The last 14 years, 15 years of my life have flown by. And that's the only way I can truly explain it," the 38-year-old said. "There's no reason why — it's not his fault, and it's not my fault."</p><p>Iglesias and his dad, who is the best-selling Latin music artist in history, have had a strained relationship over the years. Last year, the 70-year-old said he would never collaborate with his son, although he did hint that one day he would spend time with his grandchildren.</p><p>"Singing with my son is something that would come off as very commercial," Spanish-born Julio told El Universal at the time. "I think that he and I will never sing together. If we sing, it will be at a dinner, when he has kids and wants his kids to sing, just like my little ones do. I don't believe in a public commercial duet between my kids and me."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Enrique and tennis pro Kournikova, 32, first met on the set of the singer's "Escape" music video in 2001. Although they've been an item for quite some time, marriage doesn't seem to be on their agenda.&nbsp;</p><p>"I've never really thought marriage would make a difference. Maybe it's because I come from divorced parents, but I don't think you love someone more because of a piece of paper," Iglesias told <a href=#>Parade back in March 2012.</a> "Nowadays, it's not taboo to have kids and not be married."</p><p>"[Marriage] isn't important to me," Kournikova added in the October 2011 issue of Women's Health. "I'm in a happy relationship — that's all that matters."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJynqpmmwqZ5yKCjnquZlsBussCtn56qXZ%2FCrbXOZqCgpJWotqK%2FjKGYrGWemsOmvoymnK1lkaO7onnKqKyrppmgvLetjGtnamxhbYE%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./death-of-dina-bourque-the-principal-of-iberia-middle-school-was-identified-as-the-victim-of-the-fat.html><span>←</span><span>Death of Dina Bourque: The principal of Iberia Middle School was identified as the victim of the fat</span></a>
