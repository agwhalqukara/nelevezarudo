One day a week, I get my cheat day, where I eat as much cake and pizza as I want, but I try to be pretty healthy the rest of the time."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/shutterstock_1421037284.jpg><p><span>Witherspoon has worked with Jennifer Aniston on both </span><i><span>Friends </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>The Morning Show. </span></i><span>Aniston talked about her skincare secrets in an interview with </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Byrdie</span></a><span>. </span><span>"Shani Darden is a facialist here, and I love her," she revealed. "Her retinol is so good, and her serums are fantastic… She has a great lab that she works with, and the packaging is beautiful."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/07/shutterstock_2318978493.jpg><p><span>Jennifer Garner is one of Witherspoon's best friends. Garner is a spokeswoman for Neutrogena, and shared some of her favorite skincare products and secrets with </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Shape Magazine</span></a><span>. </span><span>"I love the Retinol Pro+ Power Serum," she says. "This bad boy is no joke. I'll start with serum and sometimes while I have the serum on, that's when I'll floss and brush to give it a minute to absorb."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/07/shutterstock_2269695373-1.jpg><p><span>Witherspoon and Kerry Washington starred on the 2020 miniseries, </span><i><span>Little Fires Everywhere. </span></i><span>Washington talked about her fitness secrets in an interview with </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>SELF</span></a><span>. She says that she loves to do Pilates and works with a trainer. </span><span>"With Pilates, I get to bring my true self. I cry, I laugh.

In an interview with </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Glamour</span></a><span>, Kravitz talked about her struggles with eating disorders, and how she managed to work through them. "Everyone has their own journey," she says. "I've struggled myself with, you know, eating disorders, and pressure to look a certain way. And, you know, I've found a really wonderful balance in terms of, you know, putting my mental health and my body first, and I can't perform if I don't have fuel and if I don't feel well</span><span>."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/shutterstock_2359764263.jpg><p><span>Witherspoon and Mindy Kaling worked on the 2018 film </span><i><span>A Wrinkle In Time </span></i><span>together. In an interview with</span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span> People</span></a><span>, Kaling revealed that she has found self-acceptance. "I'm feeling really confident in my body these days, which is not something that I've been able to say for my whole life, unfortunately," she says. "I feel great. I know people are really interested in my body and the changes in my body, and I think it's flattering and sometimes it's just a little much, so I don't try to tune it in too much. The truth is that I spend so much time and energy trying to be healthy."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/shutterstock_2334502999.jpg><p><span>Witherspoon has known Kate Hudson for over 20 years. She works with trainer, Brian Nguyen, to help her stay in shape. Nguyen talked about Hudson's workout routine to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Shape Magazine</span></a><span>. "We live and die by the basics," he says. "We do squats, lunges, deadlifts, single-leg balance work, sprints, sled pushes/pulls — we are doing the strength work that athletes do."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/shutterstock_1118631752.jpg><p><span>Julianna Margulies is Witherspoon's co-star in </span><i><span>The Morning Show. </span></i><span>The actress shared some of her favorite workouts in an interview with </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>TODAY</span></a><span>.

"I wouldn't say I have a typical skincare routine as my routine definitely changes based on where I am (Nashville vs Sydney), what I'm doing (i.e; on-set or on vacation) and the weather. Over the years, I've added more oils and serums to my routine but my constant is a simple cleanser. And I'm always wearing sunscreen."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/07/shutterstock_1038854716.jpg><p><span>Witherspoon and Laura Dern have been best friends for years.

She revealed she made some changes after playing a character that didn't wear makeup. "I don't do anything to my skin but apply healthy products and get facials, and after six months of using this oil, I thought, 'Wow, there's something to this.'"</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/shutterstock_1860387787.jpg><p><span>Witherspoon worked with Oprah Winfrey on the 2018 film, </span><i><span>A Wrinkle In Time. </span></i><span>They have also been seen spending time together.

Longoria is an avid chef, and tells </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Women's Health </span></a><span>that she likes to use natural foods. "I grew up on a ranch where we ate what was on the land—when it was squash season, we ate squash for three months.

She revealed in an interview with </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>People</span></a><span> that she does restorative yoga exercises throughout her day. "I work with a woman in London who taught me how to hold my body in a way where the muscles are activated all day long," she said. "She taught me to tone [my muscles] without clenching them. You relax them and focus on the parts that need to be used, but never with tension. If you're aware of your body, you'd be surprised by the effect it can have."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/shutterstock_2303738947.jpg><p><span>Kate Winslet is close friends with Witherspoon. She talked about her diet in an interview with </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>MindFood.com</span></a><span>. "Lots of green juicing. Our fridge is always full of spinach, kale, cucumbers. I'm vegetarian and my husband is vegan, so there's a lot of plant-based focus in our home. My husband turning vegan is relatively recent, so that's been a really fun education because you have to learn to be a little more inventive with foods."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/shutterstock_2192476459.jpg><p><span>Natalie Portman is friends with Witherspoon, and the two have been photographed at events together.
