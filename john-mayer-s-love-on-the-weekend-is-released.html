Now we have a new era to look forward to.</p><p>Mayer has released his new single “Love on the Weekend” from his upcoming seventh studio album The Search for Everything.</p><p>The single highlights John’s brilliance as a songwriter and guitarist. He’s learned a lot from touring with The Grateful Dead and how much he’s grown from singing pop love songs to being a fully recognized greats of our generation.</p><p>The sound has a rock edge with a mix of jazz. It’s no surprise John is mixing genres with his ever evolving sound. His last two albums were country/folk mash that has John’s irresistible touch.</p><p>This song also has a reminiscent touch of an 80’s power ballad with some Eagles sound thrown in for good measure. Only Mayer could make something sound so fresh and new.</p><p>The lyrics still hit that heavy punch like his other greats “Gravity” or “Shadow Days.” John Mayer sure knows how to write a song that will resonate long after we listen to it.</p><p>If this single is what is to come on this album then we know he’ll do better than he’s ever done.</p><p>It makes us crave for tour nights to see him or those great summer night blasting his music down the highway.</p><p>John always has a way to our hearts. He carves our special times in our lives that we don’t want to forget and never will.</p><p>https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yZIsQ9aR3iI</p><p>Now let’s cheers to &nbsp;“Love on the Weekend” and to a new era of Mayer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51kt7C0zWakmrGVp8BuuM6vnGavlZq4prrDZqmepJWWwKawjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./anastasiya-kvitko-the-russian-kim-kardashian-breaks-the-internet-again.html><span>←</span><span>Anastasiya Kvitko The Russian Kim Kardashian Breaks The Internet Again</span></a>
