Her hit songs have made her incredibly wealthy, but is she a billionaire?</p><p><strong>Nicki Minaj is not a billionaire. She is a millionaire and frequently raps about having money, but has not become a billionaire yet.&nbsp;</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Nicki’s Net Worth</h2><p>Nicki Minaj’s net worth reached a staggering <a href=# rel=noopener>$100 million</a> in 2020. She may not be a billionaire, but this is still an impressive and unprecedented amount of wealth.&nbsp;</p><p>Nicki Minaj became the <a href=# rel=noopener>first female rapper</a> to amass a net worth of $100 million. Her record label, Young Money, tweeted to announce her feat.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"></figure><p>Nicki’s highest-grossing year on record is 2013, when she <a href=# rel=noopener>earned $29 million</a>. After 2015 she became more discreet and did not disclose her yearly earnings.</p><p>Nicki’s high salaries earn her a place among the most profitable rappers of all time. She <a href=# rel=noopener>was ranked</a> the 21st richest rapper before hitting her $100 million milestone, but now would land a spot closer to the 12th richest rapper in the world with her updated worth.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Nicki’s Lavish Lifestyle&nbsp;</h2><p>Nicki lives in glamorous mansions in the Los Angeles area. She used to pay <a href=# rel=noopener>$35,000</a> per month to rent a Beverly Hills mansion with her boyfriend <a href=# rel=noopener>Meek Mill</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>When the couple split, Nicki looked for a place of her own. The couple’s previous home ended up with another superstar tenant, however, when Mariah Carey <a href=# rel=noopener>moved in</a>.</p><p>The Beverly Hills neighborhood is known for its celebrity residents. Nicki’s old house was built on the <a href=# rel=noopener>same property</a> where <a href=# rel=noopener>Frank Sinatra</a> once lived.</p><p>Nicki now lives in a different mansion in the Los Angeles area, although fans cannot pinpoint exactly where she lives or how much it costs. She may be keeping her new house a secret for her own safety.&nbsp;</p><p>Nicki’s previous mansion was <a href=# rel=noopener>burglarized in 2017.</a> Thieves reportedly stole and damaged $200,000 of Nicki’s property.</p><p>Although Nicki lost a large sum of money and assets to the robbers, she still has plenty of funds in the bank. Their theft was just a minor financial setback to the star, whose wealth has continued to grow every year.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Nicki’s Jaw-Dropping Cars</h2><p>Nicki does not just live in expensive mansions. The wealthy rapper is also known for driving impressive and rare cars.&nbsp;</p><p>Nicki’s most characteristic car is her pink Lamborghini Aventador. The car itself is worth <a href=# rel=noopener>$400,000</a> or more, and her paint job cost an extra <a href=# rel=noopener>$30,000</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram"></figure><p>Nicki also owns a <a href=# rel=noopener>Range Rover</a> and even wrote a song about it. The unreleased track, <a href=# rel=noopener>“I Love My Range Rover”</a> was leaked in 2012 and has lyrics about her impressive car.</p><p>Nicki drew attention when she rolled up to the <a href=# rel=noopener>2014 MTV Movie Awards</a> in her <a href=# rel=noopener>Maybach 62S</a>. The car costs over $500,000 and has extravagant features such as two backseat TV screens, fabric curtains, self-closing doors, and a large sunroof.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Nicki Raps About Money</h2><p>Nicki does not shy away from flaunting her wealth in her music. Nicki notably discussed her wealth in her unreleased freestyle rap <a href=# rel=noopener>“I Get Money.”</a></p><p>Nicki also released the money-themed track <a href=# rel=noopener>“Money On My Mind.”</a> This song was a collaboration with fellow rappers <a href=# rel=noopener>Busta Rhymes</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Brinx</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Nicki’s bold track <a href=# rel=noopener>“Rich Sex”</a> also asserts the singer’s love of money. She raps about her wealth and how she values money over relationships with men. The lewd lyrics talk about sexual acts and money, and Nicki raps that a man cannot be handsome if he is broke.&nbsp;</p><p>Nicki embraces the <a href=# rel=noopener>rap culture trend</a> of making songs about money. This is a longstanding tradition that has existed within the genre for generations, so Nicki is putting her own twist on the common theme.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Nicki Donates to Charities&nbsp;</h2><p>Nicki definitely loves her money, but she does not keep her wealth to herself. The singer is a known philanthropist who has donated considerable funds to meaningful charities.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2017 Nicki revealed that she <a href=# rel=noopener>donated money</a> to a small village in India. She helped the villagers gain essential technology for a computer station, tailoring institute, and water wells.&nbsp;</p><p>Nicki is also donating a <a href=# rel=noopener>portion of proceeds</a> from her <a href=# rel=noopener>“Trollz”</a> single directly to <a href=# rel=noopener>The Bail Project Inc</a>. Nicki explained that this fund helps pay bail for the incarcerated, a part of the #BlackLivesMatter movement.&nbsp;</p><p>Nicki has huge sums of money and is proud of her financial gains. However, the singer is not stingy and openly donates to causes that she believes in.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jqKqZqaZmLiqecyipZqiXZZ6o7XLpaCoppGev6Z7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dj-akademiks-net-worth-age-girlfriend-house-wiki.html><span>←</span><span>DJ Akademiks Net Worth, Age, Girlfriend, House, Wiki.</span></a>
