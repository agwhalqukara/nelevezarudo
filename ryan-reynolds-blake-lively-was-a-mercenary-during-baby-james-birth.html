Reynolds and Lively welcomed their first child together in late December.</p><p>"Right now she's starting to say 'mama,'" he dished. "There's an unfair advantage there. It turns out that breasts are actually a life support system and the child seems to gravitate towards the breasts. I'm just the breastless a–hole wandering around the room and getting in her sightline every once in a while."</p><p>"All about mom. I am dead to her," Reynolds, in head-to-toe Salvatore Ferragamo, joked about his baby girl. "That's her first words, ironically. 'You're dead to me.'"</p><p>The Green Lantern hunk also revealed what it was like when Lively gave birth. "I was there in the delivery room. I mean, I was there for the conception of the child, so I thought the least I could do is be there in the delivery room," he dished. "I'm not going to lie to you… I saw things. But, amazing!"</p><p>In fact, Lively deserves a medal, according to her husband. "My wife is the real, I mean she is a mercenary," Reynolds gushed. "At one point in the middle of the delivery, the doctor's cell phone went off and she said, 'Oh, no. Go ahead, take a personal call. Feel free.' She was cracking jokes in the delivery room. She may have been on drugs, but I don't ask personal questions."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Reynolds said he sort of helped out in the delivery room. "I was just a terrible coach," he confessed. "There was a lot of clapping. I went for a couple of high fives, but she did not."</p><p>Like her husband did on Conan, Lively gushed about first-time parenthood <a href=#>in the May issue of Allure</a>. "I feel like I've figured out the most important thing to me," Lively, 27, said of being a mom. "And everything supports that."</p><p>The Age of Adaline actress — who shared <a href=#>a breastfeeding photo</a> last month via Instagram — joked that it was a "full-time job." Lively added, "I'm like, driving down the road, pumping."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpKilo2S7psPSaKmymZ5iv6bFzaijnatdl7mit8Rmo6KulaHGbsPArGSaZZ2av6SxzZqpsmWUqr%2BqusZmmZqaqWK3ornErGSboaKptW5%2Bj2psbnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./park-chu-young-a-look-into-one-of-the-strangest-arsenal-signings-news-scores-highlights-stats.html><span>←</span><span>Park Chu-Young: A Look into One of the Strangest Arsenal Signings | News, Scores, Highlights, Stats,</span></a>
