He is 12 years old and born under the Sagittarius astrological sign. He is an American citizen.</p><p>John Travolta is his father, and Kelly Preston is his mother. Additionally, he has two siblings named Jett and Ella Bleu. Similarly, Benjamin’s father is a well-known actor and singer, while his mother was also an actress and model. Regrettably, his mother died of breast cancer.</p><p>Similarly, his brother, Jett, is no longer with them, having died in 2009.

He must be content to enjoy and live a lavish life with his loved ones while also studying and attending school. He did, however, frequently appear on television programs alongside his parents. However, due to his youth, he does not yet have a career. Similarly, Benjamin was able to make his reluctant television debut on “The Late Show” in a 2015 episode.</p><p>In terms of his father, John Travolta is an actor and singer who rose to prominence in the 1970s.

His father, on the other hand is worth $250 million.</p><h2>Benjamin Travolta Girlfriend, Dating</h2><p><strong>Benjamin Travolta</strong> is far too young to be involved in any type of romantic relationship. He must prioritize his education and enjoyment of life over a romantic connection. He does, however, have a sizable following at the moment.
