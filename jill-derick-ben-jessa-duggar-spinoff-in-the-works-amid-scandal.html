Although TLC has yet to announce any cancellation plans, sources tell <strong>Us</strong> they’re actively working towards a spinoff.&nbsp;</p><p>“They’ve invested a lot of time in developing these story lines and the last thing they want to do is to throw it all away,” a source tells<strong> Us </strong>of the controversial Christian family’s show, adding that Josh, however, will not be a part of any filming.</p><p>While fans might be happy to see the lives of their favorite Duggars continue to play out on TV, former TLC star <strong>Mama June Shannon </strong>has threatened a lawsuit against the network, which similarly pulled her family’s show, Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, off the air following her own scandal.&nbsp;<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I didn’t even do anything. It was just speculation over, like, rumors. I never dated the guy, I never touched my kid — I think that’s disgusting,” Shannon told Extra in an interview on Tuesday, May 26. “And our show was canceled immediately…It wasn’t no break with us. It was like, seven hours after the news broke, canceled!”</p><p>On May 22, TLC announced 19 Kids and Counting would be pulled from the air until further notice. “We are deeply saddened and troubled by this heartbreaking situation, and our thoughts and prayers are with the family and victims at this difficult time,” the network said in a statement.</p><p>Amid the mess — advertisers including Walgreens, David’s Bridal, Payless and more companies have <a href=#>chosen to pull their ads</a> from the network — the Duggar family continues to stand by Josh. In a statement posted to the family’s website, parents <strong>Jim Bob </strong>and <strong>Michelle Duggar </strong>said that their 27-year-old son’s “very bad mistakes” caused them to draw closer to God.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOo6ClpF2ZsrO1wqRkm52eYremv9KaZJ2tl5yus3nSqaCnp5abeqq6jK2fnmWnpL%2Bsv4yapKKcXaiworrDmqNmamBmgnODlA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./eric-benet-s-wife-manuela-testolini-pregnant-again-celebration-photos.html><span>←</span><span>Eric Benet's Wife Manuela Testolini Pregnant Again, Celebration Photos</span></a>
