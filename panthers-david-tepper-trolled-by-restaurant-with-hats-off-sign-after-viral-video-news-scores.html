Stroud, only for Tepper to push for the selection of Young.</p><p>In November, Tepper denied the rumors, <a href=# rel=noopener>telling reporters</a> that taking Young was a choice shared by many within the organization:</p><p><i>"Just the way our processes go here, I'll just answer this really plain. In all those decisions, whether it was [hiring] the head coach, whether it was [drafting] Bryce, I don't really vote on those decisions until the last piece, OK? So those decisions are made by ... the football people.</i></p><p><i>"Now, look, everything that's right and everything that's wrong here ultimately is my fault, OK? I have the final say. But as far as those decisions, whether it's Frank Reich or it's Bryce Young, those decisions were made, and in the case of Bryce it was almost‚ÄîI believe it was a unanimous decision, and the coaches and the scouts had very strong opinions at the time."</i></p><p>Early returns suggest that the Panthers may have made a huge mistake, as Stroud had a spectacular rookie season, and Young struggled.</p><p>While Stroud was named NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year and surprisingly led the Texans to an AFC South title and a playoff win, Young went just 2-14 as a starter, throwing 11 touchdown passes and 10 interceptions.</p><p>To further exacerbate the situation, Panthers would have had the No. 1 overall pick in the 2024 NFL draft, but they traded it to the Chicago Bears to move up to select Young. With what was originally the Panthers' pick, the Bears took USC quarterback Caleb Williams first overall this year.</p><p>The Panthers did manage to get into the first round of the 2024 draft, though, trading up from No. 33 to No. 32 in order to secure a weapon for Young in South Carolina wide receiver Xavier Legette.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYW6BcYWMqZinrJiav7R5w5qtopxdqbKxvMSrZK2qn6G5prCMm7BmqpWowaLB0ZqlrWWnnsGpeceaq6xln5uzbr%2FIoKVmmZapsrN51aKpmqRdq7alsc4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./molly-burnett-partner-who-is-the-queen-of-the-south-star-dating.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Molly Burnett Partner: Who Is the Queen of the South Star Dating?</span></a>
