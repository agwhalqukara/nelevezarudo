Cox/Getty Images</span><p>Indianapolis Colts quarterback Anthony Richardson is reportedly "full go" as he returns from shoulder surgery.</p><p>"This is progressing really well. I'm told Richardson feels he's full go at this point," ESPN's Jeremy Fowler said on <i>SportsCenter</i>. "He's been throwing for a while now. He's gradually grown to where he can throw full time with minimal restrictions. The Colts could be deliberate. They could hold him out for OTAs, 11-man work, minicamp, but the feeling is he wants to get started."</p><p>Richardson was limited to just four games last season, throwing for 577 yards and three touchdowns against one interception while adding 136 yards and four scores on the ground.</p><p>While the Florida product was electrifying at points during his rookie season, his style of play also made him prone to contact. He missed time with a concussion before suffering an AC joint sprain that ended his season.</p><p>The Colts are hoping Richardson's return will propel them to the postseason after a 9-8 record last year. They allowed backup Gardner Minshew to leave for the Las Vegas Raiders in the offseason and will have Joe Flacco and Sam Ehlinger behind him on the depth chart.</p><p>Richardson was viewed as a raw prospect coming out of Florida, so it's possible allowing him to take nearly a full season to watch from the sidelines will help in his development. There were times when Richardson was the best athlete on the field but could still clearly be seen processing.</p><p>It's likely the Colts will want to take things as safe as possible in his recovery. Pushing him too hard too soon could result in him being re-injured or never fully healing, which would be less than ideal given Richardson's arm strength is a big reason the Colts took him so high in the 2023 NFL draft.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYW6Gc36Mp52lZaKqurC%2B0maaqKSkqHqiutOhpqexXae2pLTAq5usp55is6axy6xkn62coXqou4yfpqWkn6y2r7OMrKyrn5Wnxm67zWagp6Klp8Y%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./charisma-carpenter.html><span>←</span><span>Charisma Carpenter</span></a>
