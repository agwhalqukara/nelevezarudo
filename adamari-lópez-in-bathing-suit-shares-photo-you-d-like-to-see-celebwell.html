She opened up about the program to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>People</span></a><span>. "Many people have found it very fast (his physical change) but I have been trying for two years now," she says. "I joined WW (Weight Watchers). At first, it was frustrating not to see it happen so quickly. Then the pandemic came and it came back for back."</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/02/shutterstock_108350585-1.jpg><p><span>Lopez opened up about her weight loss process to People. She says that she realized that she had to cut some things out of her diet in order to succeed. Specifically, Lopez had to stop drinking soda. "I started the challenge and exercising, but I did things that didn't allow me to reach my goal. I kept drinking soda. And I didn't achieve what I wanted, until I put my foot down. I started cutting down on portions of food and giving up soda completely. That cost me a lot."</span></p><p><span>While Lopez did cut some things out of her diet, she doesn't like to deprive herself. She tells People that she believes in eating a balanced diet. "Sometimes I thought I couldn't, but in the end it's perseverance, sacrifice," she says. "I don't deprive myself of other things because I continue to eat rice but in a moderate portion."</span></p><p><span>Lopez tells People what she typically eats each day. "I eat a boiled egg in the morning, or an egg in any presentation as my main food. I drink water or a little natural orange juice. This is from Monday to Friday when I'm on Telemundo. I come home and eat a third cup of rice with another protein and some vegetables or salad —or with tomato and cheese— and lots of water."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/02/Adamari-Lopez.png><p><span>Lopez posts a lot of workout videos on Instagram.
