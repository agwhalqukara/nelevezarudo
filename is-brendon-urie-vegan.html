At the Disco and the band has a host of popular hits.</p><p><strong>There are many rumors online that Brendon Urie is a vegan or vegetarian, however, there is little evidence for this. There are images online of Urie eating meat, indicating that is not vegan.</strong></p><p>Find out more about Brendon Urie, his career, and his approach to veganism by reading below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Brendon Urie?</h2><p>Brendon Urie was born in Utah but relocated with his family to Las Vegas in his early childhood. He was raised as a <a href=# rel=noopener>Mormon</a>.</p><p>“I still use a lot of good values from growing up in the Church,” he told the Independent. Now, though, Urie has a new faith. “Meeting fans and interacting with other bands has become a new religion to me, one that’s overwhelmingly beautiful and enlightening.”</p><p>Urie has ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) and has spoken openly about his experiences of this. “From the time I was in school until I was about 13, teachers didn’t know what was wrong with me,” he told <a href=# rel=noopener>Fuse</a>.</p><p>He was prescribed medication to help manage his symptoms but later decided to stop medicating the condition. “I would rather be myself and cope with this than just numb this,” he explains.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Music</a> was a key element of Urie’s childhood, and was, in many ways, a therapy to the bullying he experienced. “I had family and friends, and teachers that were willing to show me how passionate you could be with the thing that I already loved, which was music.”</p><p>Urie <a href=# rel=noopener>met his wife</a> Sarah at a Panic! At the Disco show, however, their relationship did not immediately begin. They were later reintroduced through Hayley Williams, from the band Paramore.</p><p>They began a relationship, and in 2011 announced that they were engaged. The couple <a href=# rel=noopener>married</a> in 2013 in a ceremony in Malibu.&nbsp;</p><p>Urie credits his relationship and the shift in lifestyle that it created, as the inspiration behind the Panic! At The Disco album ‘Death of a Bachelor’.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Veganism</h2><p>In an interview, Urie cited his favorite foods as “beer, pizza, sandwiches, chips.”</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Happy Cow</a> includes him on their list of famous vegetarians, however, fans were quick to respond and correct this.&nbsp;</p><p>There are also <a href=# rel=noopener>photos</a> online which show him sitting at a restaurant, with the dish in front of him appearing to contain meat. He can also be seen eating bacon in a <a href=# rel=noopener>YouTube video</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"></figure><p>In 2015, Urie’s wife Sarah shared a photo of a meat-free alternative to beef, saying she was “Trying to keep up with being a vegetarian.” When a fan asked if her husband would also be vegetarian, she responded “Just when he’s home,” further implying that Urie is not vegan.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Panic! At the Disco</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Panic! At the Disco</a> formed in 2004 with Urie and his childhood friends Ryan Moss, Spencer Smith, and Brent Wilson. Wilson was replaced by Jon Walker in 2006.</p><p>The band has achieved huge success, with 15 songs appearing in the <a href=# rel=noopener>Billboard Hot 100</a> chart.</p><p>Panic! At the Disco has been nominated for a host of awards, including Grammys, MTV VMAs, MTV Europe awards, and AMAs.&nbsp;</p><p>Urie performs under the band name, though, after his three bandmates made the decision to leave, he is effectively a solo artist. Though he expected the band to remain together, with ambitions to perform together for decades as the Rolling Stones do, it appears there are no hard feelings between Urie and the former members.</p><p>“I always wanted to do this,” he <a href=# rel=noopener>explains</a>. “They left because they didn’t want to do it anymore, which I totally get and respect.”</p><p>He boasts <a href=# rel=noopener>collaborations</a> with some of the biggest names in music, including Travie McCoy and Lil Dicky. The track ‘<a href=# rel=noopener>ME!</a>’, a collaboration with Taylor Swift, reached number 2 on the Billboard chart.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2019, Urie was awarded by GLSEN with the <a href=# rel=noopener>Inspiration Award</a> for his commitment to inclusivity and LGBTQ rights.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jqKqZpqimrulu81mrKuhlWLDprPAp2Y%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./exclusive-interview-with-elliott-joseph.html><span>←</span><span>EXCLUSIVE: Interview With Elliott Joseph</span></a>
