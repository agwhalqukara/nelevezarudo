The news might come as a shock to many, considering The Leftovers star hasn’t even confirmed her relationship with Dave Gardner, whom it has been speculated she’s been dating for the past four months. The 37-year-old daughter of Aerosmith rocker Steven Tyler is already the mother of a 9-year-old son, Milo, with whom she shares with her ex-husband, Royston Langdon.</p><p>Dave Gardner, who she is rumored to be seeing and has been rumored to be seeing for about four months now, is a football agent. He’s also a friend of soccer star David Beckham, and was featured in the soccer star’s documentary. The news is great for Tyler, who has always been very open about the magic and beauty of being pregnant and brining a life into the world.</p><p>In 2008, she was interviewed by Self Magazine, and she had a lot to say about loving pregnancy. “Experiencing a child growing in your body just gives you such a newfound respect for the human body,” she said more than 6 years ago. She went on to say that she loved everything about pregnancy, even when it wasn’t so ideal simply because she knew that what was happening in her body was nothing short of a complete miracle.</p><p>“It’s not like you take a special pill and this pill makes the baby grow. The baby just grows, without your body even doing anything but breathing and sleeping and eating. That is an amazing feeling. You feel so proud of your body,” she said. Now it looks like she gets to be proud of herself once more as she waits for the arrival of baby number two. Reps for the star have yet to comment, which means there has bee no due date announcement just yet.</p><p>(Photo by Astrid Stawiarz/Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGijoq5dqcatsdFmp6udl6Our8CO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./charlie-kavanagh-suicide-durham-new-hampshire-university-of-new-hampshire-student-has-died-by-suic.html><span>←</span><span>Charlie Kavanagh Suicide: Durham New hampshire, University Of New Hampshire Student Has Died By Suic</span></a>
