&#34;I would like to say once again that neither me or Jessica have issues with our weight or bodies,&#34; she wrote on her MySpace blog. &#34;I happened to be very small built, and ive always been skinny,&#34; she said.

"I happened to be very small built, and ive always been skinny," she said.</p><p>"So I personally think that people need to stop criticizing everyone in the media these days about their issues. "Im sure you wouldnt like it if someone pointed out all of your flaws and all of your mistakes… but thats what the media does to us," she added.</p><p>Last week, <strong>Us Weekly</strong> reported that show producers and costars were considering an intervention of Grimes, 18, who is 5-foot-3 and stands at an estimated 90 pounds, and 21-year-old Stroup, who is 5-foot-8 but weighs 100 to 105 pounds.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"They want the girls to gain weight," a show source told <strong>Us</strong>. "They are trying too hard to be skinny, and it's started to wear on them. It's just not healthy."</p><p>Grimes, 18, also responded to critics who said her smoking habit is a bad influence. "I cant say that im proud of it, but there are so many people struggling with the addiction nowadays," she wrote. "I started smoking at about 16, and 1 in 5 teenagers smoke.</p><p>"I'm not going to really go into the issue, but my hope is that you will all just stop hating and get on with it," she continued. "I smoke. My choice. Im sorry if you dont like it, but this is who I am."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaHBpamFlwG6%2Fx56lmp1dnL%2BqucSsZKOdo6i2pK2MrKurp6Wlem61jJ2mp6xdna63sYybpp2xXZ7AtMHErGRraGBtf3eF</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-is-seth-macfarlane-s-net-worth-a-closer-look-at-the-creative-genius.html><span>←</span><span>What is Seth MacFarlanes Net Worth?
