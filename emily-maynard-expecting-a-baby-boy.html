The <a href=#>pregnant former Bachelorette</a>, who is already mom to 9-year-old daughter <strong>Ricki</strong>, teased the gender of her baby-to-be with an Instagram photo of <a href=#>a gender reveal cake</a> two months ago, but never revealed the sex until now.</p><p>The 28-year-old jewelry designer, who named her daughter Ricki after her late fiance <strong>Ricky Hendrick</strong>, said she’s attempting to call the shots again this time with husband<strong> Tyler Johnson</strong>.</p><p>“I told Tyler that [if] he gets to pick the last name for everybody, then I should pick the first name, and if he wanted to pick the first name, then it can take my last name and be a Maynard!” the former Bachelor contestant joked. “He did not like that. We’re still compromising.”</p><p>The formerly single mom, who lost Ricki’s dad in a 2004 plane crash, said it’ll be nice to have Johnson, whom she met in church, to coparent with.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“The most different thing for me will be having Tyler here to help,” <strong>Brad Womack</strong>’s ex said. “I raised Ricki by myself and it’s just been the two of us for so long. I’m just really excited to be present. When Ricki was born, it was a really hard time in my life, and I was so young that I really don’t think I enjoyed it or soaked it in as much as I wish I could have.”</p><p>And Johnson has proved he’s 100 percent onboard.</p><p>“I’ve been really sick, since like the day we found out,” Maynard admitted, before adding: “Tyler has seen me throw up in his gym bag — pretty much everywhere. So if he still finds me attractive after all of that, I think we’re good!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpKilo2S7psPSaJymoZyueq6t2KeYq5xdmsWxscKtoKefXZZ6o63BsmSbp6lif3F9lGppbg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./15-amazing-bodies-of-reese-witherspoon-and-friends.html><span>←</span><span>15 Amazing Bodies of Reese Witherspoon and Friends</span></a>
