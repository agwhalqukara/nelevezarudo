He was born on January 6, 1969. He is the son of Marianne and Norman Reedus, and he was born in Hollywood, Florida. His ethnic background is quite diverse, though he does have some English, Scottish, Irish and Italian in him. He is a well-versed man who has lived all over the world, and he appreciates all that he has learned from his many travels and his time spent living in countries such as Japan and Spain. Though he was primarily raised in Los Angeles, he’s moved around a lot in the past and he has enjoyed every moment of that to the fullest.</p><p>He began his adult career working for Harley-Davidson in California, and he began acting when he realized he really does enjoy the art. Some of his first work was in a theater on Sunset Blvd. in Los Angeles, but not too many people knew his name when he was working there and doing that for himself. His big moment came at a party when someone asked him to take part in their play, and he was hooked from that point forward even though he had no formal training or any idea of what he was doing at work.</p><p>He began his movie career in 1997, and he has been in many movies ever since. Though most of his roles have been smaller and he never really got the big break he needed to become as famous as some of the other actors in Hollywood, he would get that over time. It wasn’t until 2010 when he got the role as Daryl Dixon in the hit show The Walking Dead that he became a household name. No one really expected that the show would take off the way that it did, nor that it would take on the huge following that it has in the past few years. It’s become one of the most talked-about shows on television, and he is perfectly well aware of the fact that he has some big fame at this point in time.</p><p>For five years, Norman Reedus was in a very serious romantic relationship with model Helena Christensen. It was 1998 when they met and it was 2003 when they decided to go their separate ways. Since they did welcome a son in 1999, however, they made the decision to remain friendly and on good terms with one another so that they can raise their son together by being great examples for him. Not long after he and Christensen split up, though, Norman Reedus was in Berlin where he was injured badly in a car accident. He now has a titanium eye socket and he as four screws located in his nose as part of his recovery. His net worth is substantial, but he will continue to earn more money as he continues to work portraying characters that are as impressive as the one he currently plays on television.</p><p>Photo by Getty Images &nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGilqKqdlrtuvsSem66rXaOytXnWqKmtoF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./metric-liquid-measuring-unit-abbr-crossword-clue-daily-themed-crossword.html><span>←</span><span>Metric liquid-measuring unit: Abbr.
