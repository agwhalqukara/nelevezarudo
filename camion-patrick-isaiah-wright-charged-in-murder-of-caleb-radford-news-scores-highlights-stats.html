The report added Radford was "stabbed multiple times," but no further information related to the case was released.</p><p>Jacobs noted Wright is in custody and is expected to get moved to Blount County Jail in Tennessee. Patrick is being held in Bloomington, Indiana, awaiting potential extradition to the same Tennessee facility as his brother.
