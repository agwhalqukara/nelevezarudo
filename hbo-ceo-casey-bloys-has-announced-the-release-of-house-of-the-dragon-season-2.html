<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>HBO CEO Casey Bloys Has Announced The Release Of House of the Dragon Season 2</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Development for Season 2 of House of the Dragon is ongoing and will most likely be published next year in 2024. Casey Bloys, the President of HBO and HBO Max programming, verified this. Season 1 of the program was one of HBO’s most popular.&nbsp;endeavors to date and became one of the most viewed programs in 2022. Palace of the Dragon was among many program concepts submitted to the network. It was then decided to proceed forward with the tale of the Targaryen dynasty, which took place 172 years before the events of Game of Thrones.</p><p>Bloys said:</p><p>“Remember to get ‘House of the Dragon’ following up from ‘Game of Thrones,’ we developed a number of programs, filmed a pilot, created a handful of screenplays and we secured ‘House of the Dragon,</p><h2>Castle of the Dragon Season 2: A solid screenplay is #1 priority</h2><p>House of the Dragon is a precursor to HBO’s previously successful epic show Game of Thrones. Although the first three seasons of Game of Thrones were well-received for their captivating narrative and clever development, fans grumbled that the subsequent seasons had lost their luster due to bad writing.&nbsp;HBO wishes to give the viewers an unforgettable experience. They are focusing on a solid screenplay for season 2 of House of the Dragon. They’re taking their time in the hopes of repeating their first season’s success, but they haven’t ruled out showing other programs before the highly anticipated season begins.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/House-of-the-Dragon-1.jpg alt="House of the Dragon" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Bloys said:</p><p>“My belief is that a solid screenplay is the most important thing. I’m not doing it because I want to have one or two a year. I’d like to build it on the screenplays that we’re enthusiastic about.”</p><p>He went on to say:</p><p>“You have to attempt a number of different techniques. You never know what will succeed. So that’s what we’re doing right now. I have no objections to any amount of programs. There’s probably a natural limit to how many supporters can be accommodated, but I’m amenable to any number as long as we’re excited about the screenplays and the possibilities for a series. It requires time to find one that is perfect. I’m sure George [R.R. Martin] feels the same.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/House-of-the-Dragon-2.jpg alt="House of the Dragon" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>George R.R. Martin, the show’s formal creator, is notorious for taking a long time to release his books but has never failed to produce excellent work. There was also discussion of a Jon Snow sequel starring Kit Harrington, but Bloys didn’t have any concrete details to share other than the fact that it’s still in the works.&nbsp;He also verified that Season 2 of the program will not be qualified for the Emmys in 2024, so it will most likely resume in the summer of 2024.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGifm6ddmLKwecKaqp6xXZe5sMXSZp%2Baq12Wu6%2B71KeanpxdqbWmedGeo56Zo5p6sLKMoaauq5VivKd506GcZpyilrSwuoysnJqrn6N6c3s%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./governors-ball-releases-2019-lineup-featuring-florence-the-machine-sza-more.html><span>←</span><span>Governors Ball Releases 2019 Lineup Featuring Florence &amp;amp; The Machine, SZA &amp;amp; More</span></a>
