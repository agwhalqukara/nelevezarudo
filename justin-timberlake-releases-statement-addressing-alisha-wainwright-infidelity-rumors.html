As most know, Justin Timberlake is married to Jessica Biel, and they have a child together.</p><p>Reported first by Just Jared, the outlet pointed to the Instagram post from the 38-year-old musician-turned-actor in which he stated “nothing happened” between them. Alisha Wainwright, 31, currently co-stars alongside Justin in Palmer.</p><p>In the statement, Justin explained his choice to stay away from gossip blogs as much as possible, however, the recent reports began to affect those closest to him negatively. You can check out Justin’s Instagram post below:</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B5q_HOth4qJ/</p><p>As it was previously reported, Alisha and Justin were seen hanging out at a bar together in New Orleans, Louisiana. Not long after the photos came out, a source stated that Justin’s time with Alisha was “completely innocent.”</p><p>Explaining why he did what he did, Justin claimed he had one too many drinks and was deeply regretful about holding Alisha’s hand. “This is not the example I want to set for my son,” Justin said in his social media statement.</p><p>While many people online are shocked by the rumors of infidelity, other more conspiratorial users suggested this was all part of a marketing campaign for the film, Palmer, that both stars are working on, however, these theories haven’t been proved.</p><p>Earlier this year, Jessica Biel and Justin Timberlake were in the tabloids once again when the former admitted she was never a big fan of Justin’s boyband, NSYNC. In fact, during a karaoke night one evening, Jessica took to the stage and Justin had to coach her through the entire song because she didn’t even know the lyrics.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>During her appearence on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, the host of the series played a clip of Jessica Biel, in 1999, admitting she wasn’t a big fan of NSYNC. Her musical taste revolves less around boybands and conventional pop-groups, and more towards musical theater soundtracks, such as the OST for Rent.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeaqsC1tc1mq6Klkpq%2Fra3KnmSrnZyarrSx0maqrZmkmrqmutNmmJ2coprAtLXNoGSapJmotaJ51pqgp6%2BinrSpwIyipZ%2BhlJq5qsDYZqmupZ%2BnwG5%2Fk3BtbGxf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./joseph-ladnier-missing-where-is-joseph-ladnier-now.html><span>←</span><span>Joseph Ladnier Missing: Where Is Joseph Ladnier Now?</span></a>
