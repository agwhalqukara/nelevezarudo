"Probably a Niner uniform. I mean, if not a Niner uniform, probably a Washington Commander uniform. If not a Washington Commander uniform, probably a Steelers uniform."</p><p>As the 26-year-old searches for a new contract from San Francisco, the team has also discussed trades involving him. <a href=# rel=noopener>Dianna Russini</a> of The Athletic reported that the 49ers held conversations about moving Aiyuk or Deebo Samuel during the 2024 NFL draft.</p><p>He was absent at voluntary workouts as well as the team's mandatory minicamp as he looked for a new deal. He's currently set to earn $14.1 million in the final year of his contract before he hits free agency in 2025 (via <a href=# rel=noopener>Spotrac</a>).</p><p>Aiyuk met with San Francisco's front office on Monday, although a deal wasn't reached. However, NFL Network's Tom Pelissero reported that both sides are going to "keep working" in negotiations and a trade doesn't appear to be part of the team's plans.</p>Tom Pelissero <span class=acct>@TomPelissero</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>What are the biggest questions facing each NFC West team?

In March, <a href=# rel=noopener>Andrew Fillipponi</a> of 93.7 The Fan in Pittsburgh reported that Pittsburgh "looked into" a potential trade involving the 2020 first-round pick.</p><p>Commanders rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels already has an established relationship with Aiyuk, as they were previously teammates at Arizona State in 2019. Rumors continued to swirl regarding the receiver's future in San Francisco after he told Daniels that "they don't want me back" in a <a href=# rel=noopener>TikTok</a> posted on June 17.</p><p>Aiyuk is coming off a career year with the 49ers, hauling in 75 passes for 1,342 yards and seven touchdowns. While he sees himself staying in San Francisco, he also seems to be prepared for a trade before the start of next season.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmuCdHyMm6mappSku26tyLKspGWgp7KltcKtqmabn6K6orrDnqmsZaOpsqa4xKuqZpmjYrmiusOipaBlo6W8tb%2BMmqSinF1phqa%2B0marq5mUmnqzwcyoqax3opqzfsHPrKurmZOpe6S7zA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-carley-dempsey-meet-ben-dempsey-wife-relationship-and-net-worth.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Who Is Carley Dempsey?
