<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Justin Bieber Defends Kylie Jenner After Cornrows Pic: Not Racist</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Standing by his pal! <strong>Justin Bieber</strong> took to Instagram to defend his friend <strong>Kylie Jenner</strong> in the comments of one of her recent, talked-about photos.&nbsp;</p><p>Jenner, 17, made headlines this past weekend when she shared a shot of herself with cornrows <a href=#>via Instagram</a>. Hunger Games actress <strong>Amandla Stenberg</strong> <a href=#>spoke out against</a> what she saw as Jenner's willingness to participate in cultural appropriation but reluctance to bring attention to serious issues such as "police brutality or racism."&nbsp;</p><p>Stenberg's critique took off, and many commenters took it a step further by slamming Jenner in the comments of her Instagram photo. Bieber, 21, was then inspired to come to the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star's defense.&nbsp;</p><p>A screenshot <a href=#>made its way online</a> on Monday evening, July 13, of a comment that Bieber left on Jenner's cornrows photo, now hidden amongst the thousands of other messages.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"Guys leave her alone, we're all trying to figure it out and she happens to be under a microscope!" Bieber wrote, <a href=#>according to the photos of his comment</a>. "I'm the first to know this. But saying she's being racist because she wants her hair in braids is ridiculous. Let's focus on the bigger picture and instead of fighting over something stupid let's do something about equality, but it doesn't start here blasting a 17 year old kid for wearing braids smh."</p><p>Jenner initially responded to Stenberg's words, but has kept quiet in the days since the story caught steam. She brushed off the 16-year-old actress' words when they were first posted, referencing shared friend Jaden Smith by writing, "@amandlastenberg Mad if I don't, Mad if I do…. Go hang w Jaden or something."</p><p>For her part, Stenberg followed up her Instagram thoughts with a <a href=#>lengthy post on racial and gender double standards</a>, which was posted to Twitter. On Monday evening <a href=#>she added</a>, "End the 'angry black girl' narrative. It's just another attempt to undermine certain perspectives. I have strong opinions. I am not angry."&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKGuq6Seu26uyJ6ZnqpdmbKnsc2dqmajqaG2pnnJnqWnnaJirqfAxKtknKeio7%2Bww9Jmp6KbXaO8tXnRmpqiq6Rif3F9lGprcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gabrielle-union-speaks-out-on-nude-photo-hacking-scandal.html><span>←</span><span>Gabrielle Union Speaks Out on Nude Photo Hacking Scandal</span></a>
