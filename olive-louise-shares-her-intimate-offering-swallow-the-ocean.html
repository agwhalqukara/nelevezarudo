For many of us, we yearn to have a person there to provide immense affection. Finding that partner though is only half the battle. Once they come into your life, often there is a fear of losing that euphoric bliss. Olive Louise conveys that relatable trepidation with “Swallow The Ocean”. Her single gleams with soft, radiant vocals and rich, ethereal soundscapes. With lyrics such as “I’m like an ocean / I’m calm then I’m fierce / Tearing down whatever is near,” it is the ideal metaphor. In those powerful lines, Louise beautifully illustrates pushing someone away to avoid getting your heart broken. The singer admits “The odd thing is, that feeling of falling in love, it’s addicting, but when I found myself actually in it, it felt like danger.”</p><p>The New York native is recognized for her dream-like sonics and delicate yet penetrating tone. She has lived a life of tragedy, having both parents pass when she was young. That raw pain can be sensed in her releases, but there is also a feeling of delight and hopefulness as well. “Swallow The Ocean” provides that same bittersweet sentiment. The piece scoops you up in its wistful warmth and does not let go.</p><p>Take a listen to the new song and tweet us your thoughts @<a href=#>celebmix</a></p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51kvK211Z5kpaelnsCmedKhmKudo2K1pr6MoqWtoZ2WwaZ5zp%2BdnqqZo7Ruv9aao6Wnp2LBqbGMqJqemZ5k</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./counting-on-secrets-revealed-what-can-we-expect-from-the-duggar-family-in-season-9.html><span>←</span><span>Counting On Secrets Revealed!
