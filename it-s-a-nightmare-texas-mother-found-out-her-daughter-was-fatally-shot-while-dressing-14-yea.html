She was transported to the hospital, where she was pronounced dead.</p><p>The circumstances around the shooting are unclear, and police have yet to release any additional details.</p><p>However, according to the report, 19-year-old Damariya Sowels was detained and charged with tampering with evidence. He also had warrants for a separate case.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/atlantablackstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Dalls-6-year-old-shot-600x349.jpg><p>It’s alleged that Sowels told investigators that he bought two handguns, including one MAC-10, into the townhome. It has been reported that he admitted to placing the gun on top of a game system.&nbsp;</p><p>Officials claimed Sowels attempted to hide the weapons inside a backpack in the garage, which police ultimately found during their investigation, per CBS News.</p><p>Ross’ death comes shortly after the recent passing of her brother — another victim of gun violence.&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s a nightmare. We’re living in a nightmare right now,” the sibling’s grandfather, Michael Key,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told&nbsp;</a>NBCDFW. “Dealing with the loss of two grandbabies back-to-back. It’s hard right now, especially this little one. This was my heart.”</p><p>Their mother, Brittney, found out about the incident while planning the funeral for her son, Ah’bralen Rider, who was fatally wounded on Dec. 29. A teen was taken into custody in connection to his death.</p><p>“My daughter was out at Golden Gate Funeral Home getting my 14-year-old grandson dressed for a burial we’re going to have Saturday,” Key added. “She got a call from one of the kids here, and she dropped everything and flew here.”</p><p>Key said that Sowels, who police claimed also had a Glock 40 inside the bag, was his grandson’s friend. During an interview with CBS Texas, Brittney <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">backed</a> Sowels saying that he had the weapons in his possession for “protection” after receiving threats following Ah’bralen’s death. She also emphasized that Sowels didn’t intend to hurt her kids.</p><p>Now, the family is trying to figure out how to combine the sibling’s funeral while grappling with emotional turmoil. They created a GoFundMe to assist with the cost of their memorials and raised nearly $6,000 as of Tuesday.</p><p>Key told the news station that the gun shouldn’t have been in the home in the first place.</p><p>“When I think about it, it shouldn’t have been an accident because no gun should’ve been in this house, and no gun should’ve been in the sight of a 6-year-old child,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX91e49qZmpuX6myua3SZqSorJiav26yzq6lnWWfqsFutMSrZJ2ZpZy1tbHRZq6aq12brrWty6WwZquYpMFuw8eio55llKeytL%2FIp55mnp%2BneqfBzZ6pmqRf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./britney-spears-husband-sam-asghari-slams-kevin-federline.html><span>←</span><span>Britney Spears' husband Sam Asghari SLAMS Kevin Federline</span></a>
