Foster’s husband, <strong>David Foster</strong>, was also in attendance at the birthday lunch and the gala the previous night before.</p><p>According to an eyewitness, Bella emerged from the afternoon get together with flowers in hand, after which she and The Weeknd, 25, briefly joined her older sister and Jonas back at Gigi’s Lower East Side apartment before heading back to their hotel.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>On Thursday, Foster revealed that both Bella and her youngest son, <strong>Anwar</strong>, have <a href=#>also been suffering from Lyme disease</a> since early 2012. The Real Housewives star’s battle against the tick-borne disease has been documented on Bravo’s hit reality show, and she has been open about her struggles on social media.</p><p>“Watching my babies struggle in silence in order to support me and my journey struck the deepest chord of hopelessness inside of me, and it’s because of them that I’m motivated to stand here in front of you today,” she said at the gala, where she received a Power of One trophy.&nbsp;</p><p>“I don’t deserve this award,” she continued. “This award is for Anwar and Bella. This is my token and my promise to you that I will not allow you to live a life of pain and suffering. I will walk to the end of the earth to find a cure so that you can live a healthy life that you deserve.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaLCopJGjsaJ5xaiqrZ2iYrWiusasZLChpJ16qLXGomSbnZyhrm60wJ2gnWWRo7FuwMeeoKtlkqTGp77InqWdq12ltqR5kWlobnFhZQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./walt-whitman-creation.html><span>←</span><span>Walt Whitman creation</span></a>
