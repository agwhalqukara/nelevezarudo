After making the next two attempts, he backed up to 45 yards and shanked it. He attempted a 45-yarder again and missed, with the ball sailing wide left," noted ESPN.com's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jenna Laine</a>.</span></span></p><p><span><span>"He's struggling," coach Dirk Koetter </span>said<span>, per Laine. "He's struggling a little bit right now. He's gotta work his way through it."</span></span></p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Roy Cummings</a> of 620 WDAE on Monday, the rookie kicker is already talking to a variety of people to fix his problems, including former kicker Ryan Longwell. He has reportedly spoken with a<span> "mental coach" as well because his "confidence has been shaken 'a little bit.'"</span></p><p><span>On the other hand, Laine noted this isn't uncommon for players from his high school:</span></p>JennaLaineESPN <span class=acct>@JennaLaineESPN</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>For the folks making a big deal out of @_RobertoAguayo seeing a mental coach: every athlete at @IMGAFootball works with a mental coach.</p><p><span>Still, there remains a concern, as </span>Aguayo explained the problem is mental instead of physical, per Cummings:</p><p><span>I'm just focusing on relaxing and sometimes not thinking about it too much. When you're overthinking like, 'Ok, I have to do this and this and this,' you get too many thoughts in your head. Sometimes you have to sit back and relax and just kick it. That's the mindset going into practice and throughout this week.</span><span><br></span></p><p><span>The kicker also said the issue<span> "shouldn't happen with me," per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Greg Auman</a> of the Tampa Bay Times.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Aguayo is probably more surprised than anyone by his lack of success considering his confidence at the scouting combine. When asked about his transition to the <a href=#>NFL</a>, he replied, "</span></span>To me field goals, it's easier. The hashes are closer. Growing up I always thought, wow, NFL is much easier than high school, let alone college," per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chase Goodbread</a> of NFL.com.</p><p>It turns out playing at the next level is tougher than he could have predicted.</p><p><span><span>While a few missed attempts during the preseason usually aren't concerning for kickers, there is added pressure for Aguayo to perform, as Sam Monson of Pro Football Focus noted:</span></span></p>Sam Monson <span class=acct>@PFF_Sam</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Everybody misses kicks eventually, but if you're a kicker taken in the 2nd round you need to be money. Aguayo's missed 2 chip shots already</p><p><span><span>The Buccaneers selected the kicker with the 59th overall pick of the 2016 draft, ahead of many notable prospects, while avoiding plenty of other positional needs.</span></span></p><p><span><span>On Monday, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Laine</a> reported Aguayo nailed a pressure-packed field goal from 50-plus yards out that allowed his teammates to get out of practice early.</span></span></p><p>Tampa Bay is hoping Aguayo can be as consistent as he was throughout his career with the Seminoles. In three years, he never missed an extra point (198-of-198) while hitting 88.5 percent of his field-goal attempts. He hit two field goals as a freshman in Florida State's win over Auburn in the national title game before becoming a consensus All-American in 2014.</p><p>It's too early to judge his NFL career, but if he doesn't correct his kicking issues, his spot as a second-round pick could make him a massive disappointment.</p><p>Follow Rob Goldberg on Twitter for year-round sports analysis.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/twitter-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/follow_me-c.png alt="Follow TheRobGoldberg on Twitter" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaW9taWeDeXnRqJmeqqSkeqKz1JqwqGWTpLu1rcKtnJ1lnZq7ta3LZpqomZOdeqKy056pZqWZqMCqusZmpK6kpJ69rbGMpKCco6NixKrAx2aZrpuj</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./matt-o-leary.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Matt OLeary</span></a>
