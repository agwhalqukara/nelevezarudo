Of course Gerber, 53, rounds out the group on the far left, looking handsome in a T-shirt and shorts. Crawford's caption? A simple heart.</p><p>(We know, it's almost overwhelming!)</p><p>Earlier that day, Crawford posted another shot—this one featuring just her budding model daughter.

"When your daughter steals your clothes…," the international supermodel captioned the pic.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Look who's reading my new book!</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>A photo posted by Cindy Crawford (@cindycrawford) on Jul 22, 2015 at 11:14am PDT</p><p>But on Wednesday, the model-turned-entrepreneur shared one of her sweetest photos yet: One of her husband plopped down in front of a giant fireplace, reading her soon-to-be-released book, Becoming.
