It was during this tragic time that she resolved to distinguish herself. Not as one-half of a remarkable husband-and-wife team — her husband help shape physics as we know it today (per <a href=# rel=noopener>Biography</a>) — but as a brilliant and pioneering scientist in her own right. There’s no denying that she accomplished just that, nor that she attracted a great deal of controversy along the way.</p><p dir=ltr>The <a href=# rel=noopener>American Institute of Physics</a> explains that five years after her husband’s death, a scandal arose involving her and one Paul Langevin. He was a fellow scientist who had reportedly relocated to the French capital alone, his relationship with his wife seeming to be damaged beyond repair. Curie and Langevin developed a working relationship and attended a Belgian scientific conference in 1911 with other big names in their field — Albert Einstein among them.</p><p dir=ltr>It was believed that the pair had become much closer beyond a professional level. In <a href=# rel=noopener>“Marie Curie: A Life,”</a> Susan Quinn writes, “by mid-July of 1910, all the evidence suggests, Marie and Paul had become lovers. On July 15, they rented an apartment together near the Sorbonne.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnpJ2ybr%2FCmqWdmZxiwamt02aYpaWfqMFusMSsq6unqZqxbrnAq6CeZZOqv6qx0maamqqVmr9w</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./osama-bin.html><span>←</span><span>Osama bin ___</span></a>
