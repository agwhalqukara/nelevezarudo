Eleven days later, the NBA and NBPA announced that his No. 6 would never be issued again. Players who sported the number pre-retirement, such as James, are allowed to continue to wear it.</p><p>The former Boston Celtics star's impact went far beyond the basketball court as he fought against racial inequality. President Barack Obama honored Russell with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the United States' highest civilian honor, in Feb. 2011.</p><p>Russell is also the namesake for the NBA's MVP award, which James has won four times.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloZWWFdYSMpZiknaKoeq2xwaump2Walrqmv4ytmKWjo2LAqrPNop2im5GjsKZ5zp9ksJ2Rp7avs4ynpmZuXZaztbHRZpmipJxiv7a%2F0p6jpatdmbKiwMc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kristen-stewart-scandal-did-she-cheat-on-robert-pattinson-with-rupert-sanders.html><span>←</span><span>Kristen Stewart Scandal: Did She Cheat On Robert Pattinson With Rupert Sanders?</span></a>
