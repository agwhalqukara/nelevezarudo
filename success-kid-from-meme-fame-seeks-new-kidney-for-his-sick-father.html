You may know him as Success Kid — that determined tiny tot who took the Internet by storm in one of the most popular memes of all time — but in real life, <strong>Sammy Griner</strong> is just a normal kid who loves his dad.&nbsp;</p><p>The Internet celeb has grown quite a bit since his now-famous photo was taken on the beach in 2007, but his family is using his stardom to help out his sick father, <strong>Justin Griner</strong>, 39.&nbsp;</p><p>Justin is in dire need of a kidney transplant, and his family has created a <strong><a href=#>crowdfund</a></strong> account to help him raise the necessary funds for medical treatment. Their goal is $75,000, and at the time of publication the family has reached more than $30,000.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>At first they were hesitant to bring up the meme, wanting the focus to be on Justin, but his wife, <strong>Laney Griner</strong>, decided that adding more attention to her husband’s condition could only help.&nbsp;</p><p>“We are just floored by the reaction,” the Florida resident told <a href=#>BuzzFeed News</a>. “I know Success Kid is a popular meme, but around here he’s just our 8-year-old son, Sam. It’s amazing seeing what broad, worldwide appeal his image has, even so many years later.”</p><p>Laney originally posted the image of her son in 2007, but it officially became the “Success Kid” meme in 2010.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“He’s been this meme for as long as he can remember,” Laney continued. “But he gets embarrassed by it plenty, too.”</p><p>But his embarrassment won’t stop Sammy from helping out his father.&nbsp;</p><p>“His dad is his hero, he’d happily do anything to help him get better,” Laney said.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKqum5OawLR5yqKbZqWVorJut8idpZ6xXai2pLeMn5itoJWnenN8kG5obWw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ray-liotta-net-worth-how-rich-is-the-goodfellas-star.html><span>←</span><span>Ray Liotta Net Worth: How Rich is the Goodfellas Star?</span></a>
