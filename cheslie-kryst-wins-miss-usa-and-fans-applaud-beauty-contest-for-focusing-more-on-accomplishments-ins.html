This is a well-deserved win. I tell people to look at what a person have done, not what they say they are going to do. Keep up the good work. We all are proud of you.”</p><p>A second supporter stated: “You were absolutely FLAWLESS. Confident, elegant and beautiful. So proud of you and my heart was beaming as you graced that National stage. Love you.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/Bw-6GM0DQMj/</p><p>A third person added: “Like y’ all do realize this is one of the best moments of this woman’s life and you’re hurling hate at her? How about be decent human beings for a moment & think about how you treat other people?”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>What are your thoughts on the new Miss USA?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeTnbK0uMieZKSqqajBbsPIp6pmpZmowG7B0ppkmqaUYrOiutJmmKmonJbCpXnBnpiurKlisLC6056qrWWWpL9uss6crKyhnpx6rrvRnmSopl2WsKS7zKmjoquYorKvwNJmoKerpJqupXnOn2SjraOpeq27zqSqZmpnbYNzfY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./african-river-that-starts-at-lake-victoria.html><span>←</span><span>African river that starts at Lake Victoria</span></a>
