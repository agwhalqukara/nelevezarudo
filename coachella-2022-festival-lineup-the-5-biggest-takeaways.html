And perhaps more than any pre-pandemic year, it’s a tricky lineup to assess.
There are a good number of returnees from the 2020 lineup that was not to be, 21 Savage, Carly Rae Jepsen, and Hot Chip among them, though that year’s headliners — Rage Against the Machine, Travis Scott, and Frank Ocean — are absent."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Pop rocks</strong>: <a href=#>Billie Eilish</a> is cool pop. Harry Styles is pop rock. And Carly Rae Jepsen, well, she’s my queen. Pop traditionally meant fluffier stuff, songs and artists who sold a ton of records. But here we’ll make the case that it’s simply music with irresistible melodies, smartly crafted, and aimed straight at the heart of its listeners.</p><p>Some of it rocks a lot: if you’ve seen a <a href=#>Harry Styles show you know how much he loves ’70s rock,</a> and Phoebe Bridgers does more singer-songwriter kind of lower-volume rock.</p><p>Some is introspective: <a href=#>Japanese Breakfast writes beautiful songs that make strong emotional connections</a>. Others, like Doja Cat, whose spot in the lineup is much higher now than it was in 2020, come from a hip-hop aspect.</p><p>If it’s a song you wanna sing along to, and it moves your heart, it doesn’t matter how much it sells, we’re calling it pop.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2.wp.com/wpdash.medianewsgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PAS-L-HEADONLINE-1103-01.jpg><p><strong>2. The 88rising effect:</strong> Like in 2020, the 88rising music company gets special billing on the 2022 Coachella lineup poster, with a tagline at the bottom pledging Head In The Clouds Forever, a shoutout to its festival which 88rising in general champions Asian and Asian American artists.</p><p>Scattered across the lineup are names that just played the <a href=#>third Head In The Clouds festival in Pasadena a few months ago</a>: Niki, Rich Brian, Joji, Beabadoobee and Japanese Breakfast among them.</p><p>But the diversity of the lineup goes beyond that one company and festival. Japan’s Kyary Pamyu Pamyu returns from 2020’s lineup, and the heavy metal Mongolians the Hu are back, too.</p><p><strong>3. Rock or pebbles</strong>: If a time traveler from Coachella 2005 happened on this lineup they wouldn’t know what to make of the rock bands on the poster, or lack thereof. This isn’t a new trend by far, but with <a href=#>Rage Against the Machine dropping out of a headlining spot</a> it feels more obvious this year.</p><p>You do still have some fine choices though. The British-Irish band Idles is a terrific post punk band. The English electronic rock band Spiritualized will float you off to some distant, groovy cloud. Australia’s King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard traffic in psychedelia. I’m looking forward to Måneskin, the Italian hard rockers who won the most recent Eurovision Song Contest.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2.wp.com/wpdash.medianewsgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/CF-2011-KANYE-06.jpg><p><strong>4. Rap still rules:</strong> With the former <a href=#>Kanye West headlining again this year</a>, rap has a prestige spot on the lineup. But the undercard is solid too: 21 Savage, Megan Thee Stallion, Run The Jewels, Brockhampton and Lil Baby are guaranteed to draw huge crowds.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/wpdash.medianewsgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/LDN-L-ELFMAN-1031.dk_.05.jpg><p><strong>5. Fresh faces and oddballs:&nbsp;</strong>Every Coachella has a good portion of acts that you kinda-really-wanna-got-to-catch. They might be rising stars like Yola or Caroline Polachek or elder statesmen like Fatboy Slim and Richie Hawtin.</p><p>Others might not fit neatly into any mold: <a href=#>Danny Elfman is both an acclaimed film composer and the leader of beloved and defunct band Oingo Boingo</a>. What he does at Coachella will pull one of the widest age ranges of any set.</p><p>Orville Peck is the fringe-masked Canadian country singer — I’m there for that. The Avalanches were fantastic last time they played the desert — I’ll be back for them.</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on ocregister.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnk6SupLTEpaOaZWJlf3N5xZ6qraGmlrluuMinnK6oXam1pnmUZpmin5eawLV505qinpmnlsa0ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./are-vanessa-hudgens-and-austin-butler-still-together.html><span>←</span><span>Are Vanessa Hudgens and Austin Butler Still Together?</span></a>
