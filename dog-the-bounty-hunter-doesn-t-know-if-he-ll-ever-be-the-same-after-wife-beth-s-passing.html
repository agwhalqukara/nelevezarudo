It’s clearly still very emotional and sad and he still doesn’t feel like it’s real but he really appreciates that there are people there for him as he ventures into a new way of life without her,’ the insider dished.</p><p>They went on to say that ‘It’s going to be an expected adjustment with no timetable of ever feeling normal because to be honest it never will be normal. But he knows so many people have his back who loved Beth and love him that he will get through it the best he can. He is determined to and will continue to honor her legacy every day of his life.’</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Dog realizes that she is physically gone but still holds onto the hope that he will one day meet her again in the afterlife. Furthermore, it feels calming to also think that she is still with him in spirit.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeUpLRuwMeeZJunpaPBunnHrqWtnaJisbCx0qerZqOepMRutcVmn56knGKyt7HRZpmeZaSdsm6%2FwKacZpmWqbKzedainZ5lkprBqb%2BMqZisq5mjtG5%2BmHJqbWtf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bailey-hurley.html><span>←</span><span>Bailey Hurley</span></a>
